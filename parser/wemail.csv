Keep up the good work!|I want you to know that I understand your disappointment at not receiving the promotion you wanted.

Doe's spokesperson, Jane Doe, says that this policy measure is being enacted in an effort to curb revenue losses of the past three years. Doe, the largest employer in Springfield County, with offices, production plants and warehouses in both Springfield and Centerville, employs over 20,000 persons. The freeze will act in conjunction with several internal reorganization measures set to streamline management in all salaried divisions. Workers in hourly positions will also see nominal reorganization in their departments. No layoffs are scheduled to take place as part of the reorganization.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Jane Doe states that the corporation has sought the advice of an outside consultant responsible for the successful reorganization strategies of such multinational interests as the Doe Group. The reshuffling will necessitate some personnel retraining. To this end, Doe has hired a team of corporate educators specializing in this type of transition. A company analyst states that the hiring freeze should last no longer than three months, the amount of time allotted for the completion of all the steps of the reorganization. Volume, quality and pricing of shipments leaving Doe's plants will be unaffected by the changes. A more efficient operation will greatly benefit everyone directly and indirectly associated with Doe International. The improved corporate fitness will give Doe International the boost it needs to continue as a leader in the industry well into the twenty-first century.|FOR RELEASE AFTER:<br><br><br><br><br><br>MARCH 1, 2006<br><br><br><br><br><br>For further information contact:<br><br><br><br><br><br>Doe, Smith, and Hardman, Attorneys-at-Law<br><br><br><br><br><br>Attn: John Doe<br><br><br><br><br><br>1500 Main Street<br><br><br><br><br><br>Springfiield, KS 12345<br><br><br><br><br><br>555-5555<br><br><br><br><br><br>Doe, Smith, and Hardman, Attorneys-at-Law, are pleased to announce the appointment of Mary Doe Jones as a partner in the firm.

140|Complaint||Appeal to higher authorities when complaint letters don't work|Since I am unable to get a helpful response from your Springfield office, I am turning to you as a last resort. I own a small parcel of land at the base of Mt. Baldy where dirt bike riders like to try their skill at climbing the steep slopes. The State has erected signs indicating that motorized vehicles are prohibited in this area because of the serious erosion they cause, but no one is enforcing the restriction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When the bikers come off the mountain, they often ride across my property, causing deep ruts in the soil and destroying the vegetation. I have confronted them on several occasions, but my requests have been ignored. When I ask your office in Springfield to enforce the restriction, they say they will, but they do nothing. I am enclosing copies of the last two letters I sent, along with photographs of the damage the bikers have done.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I trust you will look into this matter and see that proper action is taken to uphold the law and preserve the beauty of the Mt. Baldy area. I will gladly do what I can to be of assistance.|I write you in the hope that you can persuade your Springfield office to honor all the terms of its contract with me. On numerous occasions I have tried to discuss the situation with the office manager, but he is unwilling to cooperate. In short, I cannot solve the problem myself, and I want to avoid hiring a lawyer unless it becomes absolutely necessary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Enclosed are copies of the contract and documentation proving that the office has violated the contract on several occasions. Unfortunately, this regrettable performance reflects poorly on your entire corporation. I request your assistance in resolving this problem. If I can supply any other information, please call me at 555-5555.|I have written three letters to Doe Corporation and complained in person one other time, trying to get my CV joint replaced. They installed the joint less than two months ago, and it has already gone bad. I've enclosed copies of my letters, the purchase order, and the warranty.

141|Complaint||Complain about a faulty delivery or a shipping error|Last Saturday I visited your showroom in Springfield and ordered an oak desk and two matching three-drawer filing cabinets for my study. When I arrived home this evening, I found the furniture had been delivered in my absence, but the filing cabinets were the four-drawer style. Unfortunately, I can use only the three-drawer style because I lack room for anything higher.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will appreciate having these cabinets picked up and exchanged for the ones I ordered as soon as possible. Please call to arrange a time when I will be home. I trust this matter can be resolved very quickly, so I can get my files organized soon.|On March 17 I ordered a box of letterhead stationery for our central office in Springfield. We received your shipment within one week, but the letterhead carried another firm's address.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am returning the stationery under separate cover, with the needed correction noted. I will appreciate your sending me the correct stationery as soon as possible. Also, I trust you will credit my account with $4.86, the cost of returning the stationery.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for your attention to this matter.|I received my order of Doe Tulips yesterday. Unfortunately, they looked as though they had been dropped many times and run over at least once. Further, we ordered six dozen. We received only four dozen. Since these tulips would need a miracle to grow, I would appreciate it if you could send me six dozen more of the same tulips. Unless you require me to return them, I will throw the first order in the garbage. I appreciate your guarantee of satisfaction.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
142|Complaint||Complain about receiving damaged goods|A few weeks ago I ordered a terra cotta vase through your mail order catalog, but when it arrived it was shattered into several small pieces.

Otherwise, I will eagerly await the arrival of a new vase. If it can be delivered before Christmas, I will be most grateful.|We appreciate your willingness to deliver our new copy machine a day early. Unfortunately, it arrived with some damage to the front door. The machine works, but the door is an eyesore and doesn't close all the way. I have enclosed a Polaroid photo of the door so you can see the problem. I trust you will send someone to replace the door as soon as possible.|Yesterday my order of flour and sugar canisters arrived damaged. The large flour canister was in pieces.

143|Complaint||Complain about poor facilities or equipment|We wish to express our concern regarding the bathroom facilities in Doe Park on Main Street. Because of the park's convenient location, our neighborhood children spend many hours after school playing on the playground equipment. Although we ask them to come home to use the bathroom, they sometimes use the park bathroom.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Some of us visited the facilities this morning and were horrified to see their condition. Vandals have broken the toilet, leaving a gaping hole over the exposed sewer. The children claim it has been that way for weeks. The graffiti is appalling. Until something is done, the bathroom is definitely off limits for our neighborhood kids.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please, either close the facility or repair it immediately. It presents a clear danger to the public health, to say nothing of the moral pollution it represents. We the undersigned ask that your office take swift action. We will be happy to cooperate in any way we can.|I have enjoyed my membership at the fitness center for the past two years, but I have recently avoided the spa because it is so unpleasant. The shower room is especially bad. The floors have become grimy and littered with paper towels and partially used bars of soap. The non-slip mats between the stalls are disintegrating. It simply does not look or feel clean anymore.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I would like to retain membership in the center, but I also want to get good value for my money. I hope these conditions can be improved for the benefit of all concerned.|Our club, The Doe Cloggers, held clogging instruction in the basement of your bank last night. When I rented the facility, I made sure your secretary understood what we were going to do and even invited her to come. Imagine my surprise when we arrived to find the floor covered with heavy shag carpet. Obviously, shag carpet does not go well with clogs. I think it only appropriate that your bank refund our rental fee. You can mail it to me at my address below. I am sure you will understand. I look forward to my refund.|I need to call your attention to the poor condition of the playground equipment outside our apartment. The swings are damaged, the paint is peeling, and most of the bolts which should attach the slide to the rest of the unit are missing. The equipment has been in this poor condition since we moved here and poses a danger to the children in the complex.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please would you have it repaired or removed? I would be happy to assist with any labor that may be involved in removing it. Unfortunately, I am unable to deal with the problem on my own, as the equipment is anchored in concrete.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
144|Complaint||Complain about harassment|"Several weeks ago I received your invitation to join the ""Flower of the Month Club"" and to enter your sweepstakes. I declined the flowers offer, but returned the form qualifying me for a chance in the sweepstakes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since then I have received monthly shipments of flowers, which I have returned marked ""refused, not ordered."" I have also received threatening letters telling me that I owe you over $85.00. I have sent you two letters (copies enclosed) explaining the misunderstanding and asking you to correct the problem. Today, I received a threatening letter from a collection agency, demanding payment for the flowers I returned.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since I have refused the flowers and have explained the situation twice before, I consider this to be harassment. I will not be bullied into paying for something that I did not order. If this continues I will take legal action rather than have you tarnish my good credit rating"|I understand that my payment is three weeks late, but that does not justify your collections office's actions. During the past five days I have received three telephone calls and four letters. In addition, one of your representatives has contacted three of my relatives who have nothing to do with my finances. By anyone's definition this is harassment. I expect you to stop contacting me every day and to stop calling my relatives.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the meantime, please know that I plan to send you a payment within the next few days. The money will reach your office in about a week.|Is it really necessary to call me at 10:00 p.m. to tell me to send in a payment? I am only one month behind, and I keep in touch with your office, yet you constantly harass me. I have prepared a letter to the State Attorney General's office, describing in detail what is happening and who is doing it. If I hear from you one more time, I will immediately send that letter with a copy of this one to her office. Please leave me alone.|I do not wish to buy mortgage life insurance from your or any other company. I am already adequately insured. Your frequent calls on the subject have become a nuisance. I asked my mortgage company some months ago to remove my name from the mailing lists they make available, and they assure me that this has been done. Kindly stop writing to me and calling me, and remove my name from your list of prospective customers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If your representative calls me again I will be forced to consider further action to stop this nuisance.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
145|Complaint||Complain to a neighbor or a landlord|I am writing to remind you of the leak in our roof that needs to be repaired. As you will remember, when the last storm hit we had water coming through the light fixtures, causing part of the ceiling to break loose. Fortunately, we were able to contain most of the water in pans and buckets, so the floor was not damaged. I am worried because another storm is forecast for this next weekend. We will be out of town, so we won't be able to handle the buckets.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am sure you must be as eager as we are to ensure that no more damage is done. If nothing else, perhaps a sheet of plastic could be put over the roof until permanent repairs can be made. I would be willing to help some evening, if you would call to arrange a time.|This winter has been harsh, and I understand how difficult it must be for you to keep the walkways clear of snow and ice, but this morning I slipped down the stairs and narrowly escaped serious injury. The problem is that the rain gutter drips on the stairs when the snow melts, causing ice to build up on them when it freezes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you will correct the problem immediately, so no one else will slip on those cement steps. We were lucky that I didn't get hurt this morning. We may not have the same luck the next time. I trust that you will remedy the situation quickly. Thank you for your help.|The things I enjoy most about the trees in my back yard are the chirping birds. I don't know whether you know this, but your boys have been shooting the birds in my trees. I have left the dead birds on my lawn, so you can see the proof.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We've been friends for a long time. Please speak to your boys and ask them to do their shooting elsewhere--a target range comes to mind. I appreciate your doing this for me.|I am concerned about the way your dog runs loose in the neighborhood. I understand that it can be difficult to keep an animal confined, but it is also difficult for the neighbors to cope with shredded newspapers and messes on their lawns.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I do not wish to take any official action in this matter. We are neighbors, and I am confident that we can sort the problem out amicably. If you need help reinforcing or mending your fence, I would be happy to assist you.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
146|Complaint||Complain about an unfair insurance payment or settlement|"I have just received your letter informing me that my insurance policy will not cover my daughter's surgery because you consider the surgery to be ""elective"" and we did not obtain authorization in advance. It never entered my mind that anyone would consider surgery that would prevent her paralysis and eventual death by suffocation to be ""elective."" Surely someone made a mistake in writing us this letter, or in defining what is ""elective.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>I trust you have copies of her medical records in your possession. If not, I will have the neurosurgeon send them to you. I request that you review her case to see that her condition clearly was ""life-threatening"" and therefore not ""elective.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>She now has a chance to lead a relatively normal life, for which we are grateful. To say we have no claim to insurance coverage for her surgery is to add severe insult to injury. I am confident that you will agree once you have seen the documentation. I will await your response before taking other action."|After the fire at my Springfield residence, three independent contractors, including your own adjuster, estimated the damages to my home to be about $25,000. Therefore, I am sure you can imagine my dismay when I received your settlement of $14,000 for my losses on policy #5555, which should cover 100% of the damages.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In case this discrepancy is the result of a simple oversight, I am resubmitting copies of the estimates I sent to you a month ago, including your own adjuster's statement of the damage. Please send me the correct amount as soon as possible, so I can complete the repairs. I hope to hear from you soon.|"I just received a bill from Springfield Hospital indicating that Doe Insurance paid only $300 of a $1,300 bill, because the charges are larger than the ""usual and customary."" I called every hospital within a 40-mile radius and found that my bill would have been at least as large at every one of those hospitals. I have enclosed a copy of my original claim, a list of the hospitals I called, and a copy of my most recent bill that reflects your underpayment. Please look at my case again. I am sure that you will agree to pay my entire bill."|"I received your check in the amount of $860 as your settlement for the hail damage to the awning behind my home.

147|Complaint||Complain about community problems|During the last three months, five homes in our area have been burglarized. As you can imagine, we are very concerned about this trend and hope you will help us. All of the burglaries have occurred on weekend nights when many of us attend high school ball games or other community activities. It is clear that someone is targeting this neighborhood at specific times.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Several of us have met to organize a neighborhood watch program, but we feel we need more help that we can muster alone. We think that increasing police patrols at these vulnerable times and having volunteers remain in the neighborhood on some nights might help.

Most of the families could be represented on any weekday evening. Could you please let us know if this is possible? Thank you.|I have just learned of the city council's proposal to build a new street connecting 1600 South with Maple Avenue. Many of the residents and small business owners in the area are strongly opposed to such a development. For example, more than one hundred elementary school students would have to cross that road twice each day. Others have equally valid concerns.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We understand that the council has proposed an alternative route in an area where there are no homes or schools. We strongly urge you accept that proposal. I think time will show the wisdom of that choice.|The intersection of Main and Center needs a stoplight before someone gets killed. The traffic there is so heavy that it is almost impossible to make a left turn onto either street. I nearly had an accident myself last week, and I can name at least five other friends who have had close calls. Let the garbage go uncollected for a week, close down the library for a day or two, forgo fixing a few potholes, but put a light at that intersection.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for listening.

149|Complaint||Complain about overdue work or poor workmanship|We felt fortunate to get your roofing crew to shingle our new home last fall when our general contractor had legal problems. Your workers were prompt and fast; however, the heavy winds that we experienced last week ripped off several of the new shingles. When I personally inspected the damage, I found that your crew had done a very shoddy job of installing them. They had not removed the plastic covering from the backs of the shingles so the adhesive strip could take hold, and in many cases, they had only used one nail per shingle. It is little wonder that they finished the work so quickly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>According to the standard building agreement, materials and workmanship are guaranteed for one year, so I expect you to repair the roof properly before the next storm. Since a year will soon be up and fall weather will be upon us, would you please inform me by August 15 when you plan to have the work completed. I trust this is all the action I will have to take, but I am prepared to do whatever may be necessary to get satisfaction.|My brother, John Doe, recommended your company as one that would do a good job of building our exhibition booths, but we have seen virtually no progress on the project during recent weeks. Our conference is scheduled for March 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With our advance payment, you agreed to have the work completed one week prior to the opening (contract copy enclosed). I question whether you will be able to meet the terms of the contract, and am very concerned about being ready for the conference. Please call me, and follow up in writing, about how you intend to complete the work on time. If it appears that you will default on this contract, we will take immediate measures to protect ourselves.|Before I hired you to remodel my home, I asked for references from some of your past customers. All of them recommended you highly. Now I stand in the middle of a mess: Walls are torn out, bathroom fixtures are missing, doors need to be hung, and the list goes on. And, of course, we have seen neither you nor any of your employees for at least a week and a half. Enclosed is our contract stating explicitly that you were to finish my home by May 5, two weeks ago.

I look forward to receiving the check soon. I need the money by next Monday.|The CV joint you recently installed has gone bad in less than two weeks. Since I travel extensively for my work, I need that joint repaired as soon as possible. Your service manager insisted that next Friday is the earliest he can schedule the work.

151|Complaint||Complain about a radio or television broadcast|"We are writing to express our displeasure with your report on our Youth Bible Conference. First of all, it was not limited to a ""fringe group"" of one particular religion, but had the support and participation of all Protestant groups in the State. Nothing was said about the study sessions, talks, and publications that came out of the meetings. In fact, your broadcast seemed to focus on one unfortunate incident in which a homeless man had an altercation with a security guard. This was hardly what the conference was about. In all, your coverage was so inaccurate that it could lead one to believe that your station has significant prejudice against religious groups, regardless of their activities.<br><br><br><br><br><br>An apology is in order. You should consider the ramifications of such irresponsible reporting, which will surely not go unnoticed by the public. As for the undersigned and the hundreds who were in attendance, we have lost confidence in the credibility of your news reports.

Imagine my surprise as we watched ""Captain Creep"" last night when not one, but two nearly naked actresses danced across our screen into the bed of one eager actor. Money is the only excuse for broadcasting such garbage. I am writing the show's sponsors to tell them that my money is going elsewhere until this show is moved to a different time slot or removed altogether. I hope you see the wisdom of cleaning up prime time programming."|"We were very distressed by your one-sided coverage of the Springfield City Planning Commission meeting last Tuesday. You made it sound as if almost everyone present was in favor of the proposed rezoning, when in fact the meeting was evenly split. Implying that those opposed to the rezoning were a small minority, and referring to us as a ""lunatic fringe"" in your broadcast was misleading and insulting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Kindly retract your statements and apologize on the air.

His identification tag shows the name John. I was shocked to hear him repeatedly refer to some children with words such as ""bastards"" or ""dwarfs."" I couldn't believe my ears. He seemed to think it was funny.

In one instance, she said she has ""no patience in dealing with such petty transactions.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>I trust that you will speak to her about polite customer service.

A woman identifying herself as Jane Doe answered the phone and proceeded to talk in a most rude and vulgar manner. The words she used are commonly referred to by their first letter by people with manners. I doubt that she is typical of your employees; however, I think that someone should talk to her soon before your business suffers. All of us need to learn something new occasionally.

153|Complaint||Complain to a club or organization|I am concerned about the way some of our book club members use the club as a forum for their political views.

I sincerely hope we don't lose the friendship and intellectual stimulation that has characterized our club for so long.|When I enrolled my son in your Future Leaders of Springfield organization, I expected him to receive the kind of support from the leaders that would build his self-confidence. However, it seems that the organization's counselors demand immediate perfection rather than building young men through growth experiences. I now wonder whether this organization has done more to destroy his self-confidence than to build it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I would like to meet with you and the other children's parents to discuss your organization's philosophy and curriculum. I would appreciate a call to arrange a meeting at your convenience. My number is 555-5555.|When I signed up as a distributor for Doe Multilevel, I expected more emphasis on the products. At the meetings I have attended lately, John Doe focuses only on money, with almost no discussion of products. If products are not emphasized more, I will stop doing the business. Worse, the State Attorney General will probably close Doe down as an illegal pyramid scheme. We have a great product, and this can be a great business.

259|Delegation||Relieve someone from delegated responsibilities because someone else will assume them|Upon the recommendation of our search committee, we have offered the position of Director in Hematology to Dr. Jane Doe. She has accepted the position and will take up her new duties with us April 14. We are keenly aware of the important service you have given while this position was vacant. Without your willingness to step in temporarily, I don't know how we would have kept the ship afloat.

Thank you.|I want to thank you personally for the excellent job you did as acting manager of the Springfield branch. It is comforting to know that I can rely on you in an emergency. You will be pleased to know that after an extensive search, we hired Jane Doe to be the new branch manager. Jane comes to us from Centerville National Bank, where she managed their largest branch for over ten years. We were very lucky to hire her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am sure that you and Jane will work well together. She is fortunate to have such an accomplished assistant manager.|Thank you for your loyalty and hard work these past two months.

Please rectify this situation as soon as possible.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
261|Directive||Issue directives concerning specific tasks|The electrical load into the building has increased by nearly one half over what it was a year ago. This increase is mainly due to the large number of computers, printers, and copiers that are now in use. In order to keep up with the demand for electrical power, we must install another line into the building.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please schedule a planning meeting with the building supervisor, the director of computer operations, and the electrical contractor as soon as possible.

262|Directive||Issue directives concerning studies and investigations|Preliminary reports indicate that our new cereal will have high acceptance among 7-12 year-olds. However, we fear that the sample of respondents was too small and self-selecting, so we want to do a broader study before we can trust the data. Members of the Doe Group will be on site Monday, May 10, to discuss the problem.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please plan to meet with the Doe representatives and work out a survey in which we can have more confidence. It is doubtful we can get financial backing without a more thorough study. Keep me apprised of your progress.|I am extremely concerned about the leveling off of sales.

263|Directive||Issue directives to adjust territories or structures|Please be advised that beginning March 1, sales territories and quotas will be restructured, as you see from the attachment. Some changes may seem illogical, but rest assured that they have been made after careful consideration. One of our concerns has been that sales representatives have been spending more than half of their working nights away from their families. This creates undesirable stress for both the family and the company. We believe these adjustments will alleviate the stress to benefit all. We welcome your input and suggestions as we make the transition.|Explosive growth in the Las Vegas and Salt Lake City areas necessitates a realignment of our sales territories. Beginning December 1, 2002, we will split the Nevada/Utah territory. Nevada will be part of the Northern California territory under the direction of Robert Johnson.

Jane in Personnel can answer any questions you may have about the relocation.|As a result of our recent merger with Doe Corporation, it has become necessary to restructure some departments. With our head office moving to Springfield, our personnel and accounting functions will move there too, but our sales territories and offices will remain the same. Please prepare current summaries and reports using the old system up to the end of this month. The accounting system will be changing thereafter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Jane Doe in Personnel will be holding a series of meetings to explain the impact of the changes.

This section outlines our policy on charging purchases to the company.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please note that all charges must be accountable to approved sales proposals. The majority of the charges our staff has made are legitimate, and I suspect that a lack of awareness of the policy accounts for many of the rest. Please pay special attention to this policy and contact me if you have any questions.|We are concerned about the number of incidents being reported just after shift changeovers, with no one taking responsibility for them. It is therefore necessary for us to change our handover procedure. Starting on May 1, please do the following:<br><br><br><br><br><br>We hope this new procedure will solve the problems. We will appreciate your cooperation as we implement it. If you have questions or concerns, please call me.|"It has come to my attention that some employees are moving in and out of the ""clean"" areas of the surgical wing of the hospital without removing and replacing their overshoes and sterile gowns. Hospital policy is very clear on this point. Every time you step over the red line to enter the surgical area, you must take all the required aseptic measures, as outlined in the notices in these areas. Failure to do so endangers our patients and cannot be tolerated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am aware that most employees unfailingly abide by these regulations, and am confident that compliance with this very important policy will once again become universal.

We will allow unrestricted use as long as you pay Jane Doe in accounts receivable for all copies and faxes. Of course, personal use should never interfere with company use. Per page rates are posted over both machines. You will note that the cost is much less than you would pay at a copy center. This seems to be the only fair way to handle this matter. We appreciate your cooperation.|"I am implementing a new procedure for disposing of the scrap aluminum from the window shop.

266|Disagreement||Disagree about benefits (social security, retirement, insurance, etc.)|As benefits officer for Doe Associates, I received your summary detailing the health insurance benefits as well as the premiums for the insurance we agreed to buy during our January 31 telephone conversation. I have in my notes that the $750 monthly premium provided general dental, optical and medical coverage, as well as maternity coverage. Yet after reviewing your coverage summary, maternity coverage is absent from the list of expenses you insured.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Have we miscommunicated information about the premiums and types of coverage? After calling other competitors, $750 seemed reasonable for the coverage I described, but expensive by comparison if you do not include maternity coverage. If you do not include maternity coverage, this firm will withdraw its offer to buy your insurance. Please advise regarding the matter.|According to your 3 July correspondence, my medical insurance will not cover my shoulder surgery. My records indicate that Dr. Steven's nurse, Jane Doe, called your office and obtained approval for coverage for this operation (authorization number 123) prior to the surgery on August 15. I therefore request that you grant coverage at the 80% level that my policy allows.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have spoken with the state insurance commissioner, and he confirms that the approval constitutes a guarantee of coverage. I have been satisfied with the quality of my medical coverage and hope to resolve this misunderstanding quickly.|"In a letter dated July 6, you state that my windshield replacement is not covered by my policy because Walfield's Windshields is not an approved auto glass repair service. There is nothing in my policyholder's information packet that indicates that your auto glass coverage is conditional.

267|Disagreement||Disagree with a bill, rent payment, or other financial issue|On February 2, 2002, I received an invoice for $546.00 from Doe Corporation, dated January 30, 2002. Although I once had a loan from Doe, I paid the full balance on January 1, 2002. Please find enclosed a copy of my returned check endorsed by a Doe employee. According to the loan agreement, I was obligated to pay $250 per month until the loan was paid in full.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The agreement also clearly states that Doe will not charge me a penalty for prepayment of the loan. Yet the January 30 invoice indicates that the $546.00 that you are demanding is a penalty. Because of the terms of our agreement, I will not pay the amount you request. I have complied in full with our contract and I expect Doe to return my promissory note within two weeks of this letter.

The statement shows two charges at Doe Floor Covering for the month of April, when in fact I only made one purchase there, for $250.00, on April 14. The second charge of $65.00 dated April 19 is clearly an error, as I never entered the store after the initial $250.00 transaction. Please review your records and send me a revised billing statement. If it appears to be a case of fraud, I am prepared to present records of my account activity with Doe's. I have always been pleased with my Doe's account and am confident you will give this matter prompt attention.|The bill you submitted to me for the dinner you catered last night is incorrect.

269|Disagreement||Oppose legislation|I am the Chairman of the Springfield Legislative Oversight Committee, representing over 150 concerned senior citizens in our community. We are worried about the proposed reduction of transportation services for the elderly, many of whom can no longer drive. These senior citizens depend on the van service to transport them to medical appointments and grocery stores. This service allows them to remain in their homes rather than to take up residence in costly nursing homes. They benefit greatly from such independence and the welfare department saves significant sums of money that would otherwise go to professional caretakers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We urge you argue against the cut in transportation services.

It is a weak attempt to address an immediate need without considering long-range goals. How much longer will development take precedence over the environment? When are we going to realize how valuable and irreplaceable the unspoiled landscape is? You have always been a champion of the underdog. Now the environment needs your help. Please vote against the Wilderness Bill.|I am writing as a private citizen and outdoors person to urge you to vote against the Doe Bill coming before Congress this fall. This bill will decrease the already scant enforcement of laws regulating timber sales on public land in the upland areas of our state. In addition, it allows the timber companies less accountability to the people for the damaging methods of harvest they employ in sensitive areas. I have seen illegal clear-cuts, and I have seen slash burns destroy thousands of acres of wilderness, with no restitution made to the ultimate losers, the public. Big Timber may have the money now to support this legislation, but with the opposition of forward-thinking public servants like you, we can work toward balanced, long-term solutions to our land use issues.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

After our discussion, you said you were feeling much better. I also informed you that if you were to call in sick once more without medical verification, we would terminate your employment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We feel you can make a good contribution to our corporate effort, and hope that you will overcome this recurring problem. You have significant potential.|You are a congenial person to work with and you always seem to be available when new jobs start. However, I have received numerous complaints from customers about your apparent lack of follow-through. Most recently, the Does phoned to say that you had promised to finish their concrete work two weeks ago. You still have not done the work and have not contacted them. I have other complaints of a similar nature on file.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You and I discussed some of these problems last month at your quarterly review.

You have four already this month.|"You have truly been an energetic, fun-loving employee in our organization. Nevertheless, I must inform you that your continued careless use of your expense account puts your future with Doe Corporation in jeopardy. I have highlighted the more egregious excesses on the enclosed copy of your last expense report. The highlighted examples alone represent over $2,500. There are also other parts of the report that I question.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As you are aware, this is the second time in the past 12 months that I have contacted you about your expense account. The last time you passed it off as mere sloppiness on your part and promised to improve. This most recent report does not look like ""mere sloppiness"" to me. I expect a full explanation in writing no later than noon, Friday, November 22, 2002. You must justify every highlighted item on the report.

You have tremendous potential. Still, I must have full confidence in my employees."|During the past three years of your employment, you have demonstrated a terrific work ethic. Doe Motors appreciates your industry. It has, however, come to my attention that you again have taken cars up for sale for your personal use after business hours. From our prior discussion, I know you are aware that Doe is opposed to this practice. Furthermore, it is obvious the car keys are locked in the control box at night to prevent unauthorized use. You have apparently skirted that preventive measure by picking the lock.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are on probation for three months as of the date of this letter. Your authorization to remove any car from the lot during the day or night is revoked. If you do drive any car alone within the next three months, you will be terminated.

Your successes in your first year were truly outstanding. This company is no place for resting on one's laurels, however. Your productivity in the last two months has fallen rather dramatically. I cannot sit by and let management talent such as yours go to waste. While I understand the need for up-to-date machinery, the night shift in your own shop is besting your output by nearly 30%. This is unacceptable. Please meet with me this Wednesday to discuss your plan to bring your productivity back up to its excellent former levels. I would also like to see some ideas on creating a more efficient work environment in your shop. Let's work together and get out of this slump.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Perhaps this is simply a typographical error? Please correct my summary as soon as possible.|This letter is in reference to Jane Doe's home insurance policy #121212. Instead of the usual amount of $45 on my monthly statement, I was charged $375. I can only assume that you are mistakenly charging me for my auto insurance as well. Please note that I canceled my car insurance with your company in January. Please check your files and send me a revised premium notice.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Mayor Doe has pledged to address the dangerous condition of many of the intersections surrounding our children's schools. However, due to last year's extensive flooding, city coffers are nearly empty, and the funds are not available to install even one new traffic light. The intersection of Main and Center streets is fraught with danger for the dozens of grade school children who must cross these streets every day.

You are addressing real problems in our society, and because I admire the integrity and efficiency with which you use your resources to establish services and directly support your target populations, I am writing today to express my support of your pursuit in the form of a monetary donation.

We will long remember the hard work and happy moments we have shared. You have been a great team member. Best wishes and keep up the good work."|Congratulations on your fantastic new job!

I want you to know that we are very excited about your success and know that you have worked hard to earn it. At your request, I will no longer hold your position open here at Doe Corporation.

My heartiest congratulations and best wishes for your retirement.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will always remember the first day we met.

I will always remember our trip to Mexico City to introduce the new power converters. I was amazed at the ease with which you conducted your presentations, undaunted by the skeptical comments. I have tried to pattern my own presentations after what I have seen you do so successfully. I hope I can do your reputation justice!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Again, congratulations on a well-deserved retirement. Few have worked as hard as you have. I hope you will enjoy directing your energies into your other special interests.|I just heard about your retirement plans, John. It sure will be dull around this greenhouse without you. You know, of course, that you are our source of community information. After landscaping more than half the yards in Springfield, you seem to know everyone and everything. We will miss you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now you and Jane can hop in that motor home and head for Miami, but I know you'll be back. A man with a thumb as green as yours can't leave it stuck in that lifeless, Floridian sand for long. Come by and see my gorgeous chrysanthemums when you get home. Best wishes.|John, surely you're much too young to retire why you're only two years older than I am! You were my first client in Springfield, and we've experienced the ups and downs of the market together, but more ups than downs, I believe.

I must admit that Jane's and my desire to be near our families in Kansas influenced our decision. I have asked John to assume my responsibilities until a replacement can be found. Business will continue as usual, but you will no longer be required to laugh at my jokes. I will greatly miss each and every one of you.

394|Goodbye|Resignation Letters|Resign from a job in which you are not valued or appreciated|I am sorry to inform you that I have decided to resign from my position as a computer programmer in order to seek a more rewarding position elsewhere. This resignation must become effective no later than two weeks from today's date.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have concluded that my contributions here are unrewarded and my ideas ignored. I have much to offer and feel frustrated that I am consistently passed over for special projects. It is important to me to work for a company that encourages creativity rather than restricts it. Although your compensation has been fair, you have been unable to provide other types of incentives that I need.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, my time here has not been wasted. I have gained experience and have honed my skills. I have worked with a dedicated group who has earned my respect and admiration. I sincerely wish co-workers well in their future endeavors.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because you have indicated that my work is excellent, I would appreciate a positive recommendation from you should any prospective employers inquire about my qualifications. If you feel you are unable to satisfy this request, I would sincerely value an opportunity to discuss with you any reservations you may have.|This letter is to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as a technical writer, effective in two weeks.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Again, I have been passed over for promotion. Despite sterling evaluations from my superiors, the challenges and rewards I seek from my employment do not appear to be forthcoming. It is, therefore, unconscionable for me to remain with a company that neither rewards my accomplishments nor recognizes my potential.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My frustration, however, does not diminish the fact that my friendships here have been a source of pleasure and satisfaction. I wish everyone the very best.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because all my projects are complete and my assignments are up to date, my replacement should have little difficulty taking over my responsibilities. However, if any problems should arise, you may contact me at 555-5555, and I will be happy to respond to any questions you or my replacement may have.|This letter is to notify you of my intent to resign from my position as Assistant Personnel Supervisor. Please make my resignation effective as soon as a replacement is hired, but no later than the end of next month.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although I enjoy my job tremendously, I am terribly disappointed that I received only a 2 percent salary increase this year. My evaluations have been consistently outstanding, but my salary does not appropriately reflect this fact. I live from paycheck to paycheck, so I require a moderate increase in order to meet escalating living expenses.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Despite my frustration, I will always be thankful for the opportunity I have had to improve my skills and gain additional experience. Undoubtedly, my responsibilities here have helped furnish me with the expertise required for the position I recently accepted with another company at a much higher salary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because several of my co-workers share the same responsibilities that I do, the transition should not be difficult. If there is anything I can do before I leave, please let me know.|I am resigning as apartment manager--effective in two weeks. We have talked many times about apartment repairs, city code compliance and parking shortages. You continue to make promises, I continue to stave off angry tenants and the problems remain. I enjoy interacting with the tenants, but not on these terms. I also have apartment problems of my own and so I sympathize with their complaints. Please accept my resignation along with my notice to vacate the apartment, effective at the end of this month.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
395|Goodbye|Resignation Letters|Resign from a job because of a personality clash or conflict of values|Experiences over the past several months convince me that I must resign from my position as counselor, effective no later than two weeks from today. When I was initially hired at Doe Corporation, I thought that this was a company believed, as I did, that the relationship between a company and its employees should be mutually beneficial. Poor wages, infrequent raises, uncompensated overtime, routine layoffs, and an excessive workload have convinced me otherwise. Therefore, I can no longer work for a company that clearly undervalues the worth of its employees.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to thank you, however, for being a wonderful supervisor. I appreciate the time you took to discuss my concerns with me. I know you did everything you could to improve our working conditions, but the fact that your efforts have been persistently ignored by upper management is indicative that things are not about to change in the near future. I sincerely hope that my resignation does not adversely reflect upon you in any way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Two weeks should provide adequate time for me to complete my assignments. According to current policy, I suspect my duties will be assimilated in the usual way. Nonetheless, I will gladly ensure that my more difficult accounts are settled before I leave.|Regretfully I inform you that I must resign from my position as a counselor, effective immediately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Three weeks ago, my supervisor informed me that a co-worker was criticizing my work. According to my superiors, she gained access to my personal files and work bins. She then alerted my supervisor and the office manager about my supposed violations of company policy and file errors. Although I may have erred unintentionally, I think it is inexcusable to allow another employee to rummage through my area without my consent. Your unwillingness to challenge this violation of my privacy makes it impossible for me to feel secure working at Doe Corporation any longer..<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because I have enjoyed working here up to this time, my decision to resign is not taken lightly. The work is both exciting and challenging. During my tenure I have gained important skills that will be useful in years to come.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I regret that these circumstances make it necessary for me to leave abruptly. In order to allow my successor to assume my duties without undue effort, however, I am leaving detailed instructions that explain each of my responsibilities in detail.|Please accept this letter as official notification of my intent to resign from my position as a counselor, effective two weeks from today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ever since Doe Corporation hired a new manager, I have been in turmoil. The relationship between employee and manager should be one of mutual respect and support. Instead, our current manager uses bullying and verbal abuse as a management style. Unfortunately, these tactics directly oppose my personal business philosophy, which advocates a more sensitive approach. Not only is it unconscionable for me to work in such a hostile environment, it is also physically and mentally debilitating to work under such stressful circumstances.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Resigning for these reasons is extremely disconcerting but, given the circumstances, I don't feel I have much choice. Senior management does not seem troubled by John's inappropriate behavior toward his employees and I, therefore, doubt that changes are imminent. These present difficulties do not negate the fact that I have derived much enjoyment in years past from my employment here. Also, the training I received here is superior to that of other companies. These considerations make this decision especially difficult. I sincerely hope to find another position as rewarding as this one has been.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Two weeks should be ample time for me to orient a replacement as well as to fulfill my obligations. If I can do anything else to facilitate an orderly transfer of duties, please let me know as soon as possible.|Please accept this letter as official notification of my intent to retire early. If convenient, I would like to schedule my date of departure for the end of this month. However, if you feel my leaving then will present serious difficulties for my associates, I will gladly stay until the end of next month. However, I don't believe there should be any reason for me to postpone my retirement beyond that time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Recent events have motivated me to reexamine my reasons for working here. Ever since this company acquired the Doe Corporation, I have been dissatisfied with my job. When I was originally hired, we agreed that my travel time would be kept to a minimum, but now I am expected to travel across the country each week auditing files. Unfortunately, my family obligations render this expectation unacceptable. Because I enjoyed my job so much before the merger, however, I am upset that it has come to this. But since I have been given no other alternative, I am confident this decision is in the best interest of all concerned.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The company has contributed immeasurably to my professional career. I will always be indebted to you for granting the financial assistance needed to further my education and for company-sponsored training seminars, which permitted me to acquire the proficiency needed to excel in my profession.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although I plan to work elsewhere, I also intend to do some part-time consulting and would enjoy being involved in special short-term projects. Please let me know if you are interested in including me in these activities. If there is anything else you would like to discuss with me, I would be happy to meet with you at your convenience.|Effective immediately, I am resigning as buyer from Doe & Co. It is become increasingly apparent that this store is no longer listening to the fashion demands of its clientele. Instead it seems to be following the dictates of European designers that are foreign to our customers, in every sense of the word. Hence, our exotic merchandise remains on the floor for months and our accounts remain in the red. My experience has proven that customers from this area prefer merchandise that suits their home-grown tastes, and, frankly, so do I.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I do appreciate the opportunity to work here, however. I have learned a great deal about customer relations.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||
396|Goodbye|Resignation Letters|Resign from a job when forced out under pressure|Disappointing and unexpected circumstances demand that I submit my resignation from my position as Area Coordinator, effective immediately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I recently received word that my territories have been reassigned and that I must either transfer to a neighboring state or submit my resignation. Because my husband's current position is far more lucrative than mine, it is not financially prudent for me to transfer to another location. I wish to seek another position similar to this one immediately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Despite my disappointment, I want to thank you for the excellent training I have received while working at Doe Corporation. I have no doubt that the skills I have acquired will enable me to find other employment more in line with my career objectives.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My files are in order and up to date. Each one has extensive notes detailing events that took place prior to reassigning the territories. My successor, therefore, should have little difficulty assuming my responsibilities.|Under extreme duress I submit this letter of resignation from my position as Project Planner, effective today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Over the past six months, my responsibilities have slowly been eliminated. When I started here I regularly put in 60 hours a week. Now, I sit in my office with little to do. Most of my responsibilities have been dispersed among my peers; yet additional assignments have not been forthcoming. Attempts to discover why this is so have been futile. For these reasons I have concluded that I must resign.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because my duties have largely been assumed by others, my leaving should not create any major problems. If there is anything you wish to settle, please notify me as soon as possible.|Given the choice to either resign or be discharged, I hereby submit my resignation from my position as a technical writer, effective two weeks from today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because I don't understand why I have been forced to resign, I feel angry and betrayed. You requested that I quit publishing my writings on controversial topics while employed at Doe's, but you did not stipulate that I must also cease to do research. I have stopped publishing, but still you maintain that I have not fulfilled my obligation to you. In my view, this is wrongful termination and I will consult with an attorney shortly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I envisioned a long, fruitful career here at Doe's and I am deeply distressed that this is not going to be the case. My responsibilities were both challenging and rewarding. When a replacement is hired, I will gladly explain what this position entails and how to fulfill each obligation properly. Also, I will update my superiors and forward to them difficult or confusing projects that I am unable to complete before my departure.|I am resigning as air traffic controller, effective tomorrow I love my work and my record, prior to Tuesday's fatal runway accident, is flawless.

397|Goodbye|Resignation Letters|Resign for family or personal reasons|I regretfully submit my resignation from my position as personnel director, effective two weeks from today. Although I love my job, my first priority is my family, and I have decided to stay home with my newborn child. When I first learned that I was pregnant, resignation was the last thing on my mind. But, now that she is born, I find I lack the courage to leave her in the care of a stranger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Your confidence in my abilities and genuine concern for my professional growth make this decision especially difficult. I will be forever grateful for the invaluable expertise I acquired while under your guidance. Also, the friendships I have developed here have helped make my years with the company successful and productive.

To facilitate a smooth transition, I plan to stay until the end of the month to complete my projects and help train my replacement.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My reasons for leaving are of a deeply personal nature, but rest assured they are not related to dissatisfaction with my job, the company, or my co-workers. On the contrary, I have experienced immense personal satisfaction, both from my job assignments and from the close friendships I have established with my co-workers. I regret that my current situation requires that I make this difficult decision now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you will provide me with a favorable recommendation when I return to the job market. Also, if you feel there are any unresolved problems, I would appreciate discussing these problems with you so we can reach an amicable understanding before I leave.|Please accept my resignation as chief accountant, effective May 31, 2003. Because I desire to grow both professionally and financially, I have reevaluated my career goals and decided to return to college to complete my degree.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have enjoyed my time at Doe's, and I appreciate the many friendships I have developed here. The experience and knowledge gained during my affiliation with this firm are invaluable.

Would it be possible to carry your letter with me when I leave? Please inform me if this is not convenient.|I regret to inform you that I am resigning as editor on January 15, 2002. This past eight months has been incredibly difficult as Jane and I have decided to end our marriage. I will have custody of the children and I cannot juggle the demands of this job and of my children full-time. I also need to be there for them to help them cope with the emotional difficulties they face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for the terrific experience of being an editor for this paper. It's been educational, enraging, entertaining, etc. Perhaps my mastery of alliteration will help me in finding a part-time position.

Should any part-time editorial or writing positions become available, I would greatly appreciate being considered for the job. Again, thank you for everything.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
398|Goodbye|Resignation Letters|Resign for health reasons|With much reluctance I wish to inform you of my resignation as Personnel Director, effective as soon as arrangements can be made to hire a new director. Last week, while inquiring about changes in my productivity, we discussed the fact that despite adequate sleep and nutrition I had been feeling unusually tired. We concluded that a visit to the doctor was in order. Since then, my doctor has informed me that I have Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome (CFIDS). Unfortunately, the erratic hours and the fast pace of our work environment worsen the effects of my illness. For these reasons, my doctor has advised a cessation of all work activity and full bed rest for an indefinite amount of time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am distressed that poor health dictates that I must quit my job. I searched a long time to find the kind of job that not only encourages the use of my creativity and is intellectually stimulating, but also affords an opportunity to meet with a variety of people on a daily basis. I appreciate the opportunity I have had to work here and sincerely hope that I may return when I regain my health.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because my current major projects have been completed, now is the best time for my departure.

I can no longer bear the high level of stress here at the Medical Center. I am, however, glad for the opportunity I have had to work here. This past year I have learned a great deal about my capabilities, as well as my limitations. Now that I realize I am not well-suited for this type of work, I intend to change my course of study. Fortunately, I discovered this before expending time and money in a field that is not right for me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I decided to quit last week when Jane Doe notified me that she wanted to return to work here as soon as we had an opening. Since Jane is a previous employee, training her for this position would not be an issue. As she can assume my duties immediately, this should provide a workable solution for all parties involved.|Although I enjoy working here at Doe Realty, I am compelled to offer my resignation as a field representative, effective two weeks from today, or sooner if possible. I wish I could do otherwise but recent events have persuaded me to carefully examine the direction my life is taking. Unhappily, my position, which requires frequent entertaining of company clients, dramatically increases my exposure to alcohol, which has become a serious problem. Because my health and family are top priority, I must remove myself from all circumstances which could threaten my full recover from this addiction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But my job has been a wonderful experience. In addition to fostering intellectual growth, it has afforded opportunities of travel and adventure.

Furthermore, I have arranged for my colleagues and my assistant to assume my responsibilities should it take longer than is expected to find a replacement.|With much regret I advise you of my intention to resign as Director of Marketing as soon as a replacement is hired. Let me assure you, my decision to retire early is as unexpected for me as it is for you. I was recently diagnosed with a severe illness and advised by my doctor to decrease my work activities immediately. Although my responsibilities here bring me a great deal of satisfaction, they also cause a considerable amount of tension and anxiety. Hence, it is imperative that I contemplate my early retirement and plan for a more serene lifestyle.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please accept my heartfelt thanks for your support, encouragement, and cooperation over the years. I have been fortunate, indeed, to work for a company that provides a challenging yet pleasant atmosphere. Close ties cultivated with my co-workers have greatly enriched my life. My admiration and respect for them make it that much more disappointing to end my career with Doe Corporation. It is truly disheartening that the state of my health must govern my decision to retire.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because I understand that my precipitous departure could create transitional problems, I want to assure you that I will do everything possible to see that my duties are efficiently assumed by my replacement. Despite my doctor's directive, I anticipate consulting on a part-time basis during the busy seasons. If you are interested, I am available to help out on those occasions. Knowing that the door is open will help make my obligatory retirement somewhat more appealing.|It is with great sadness that I submit my resignation as Executive Vice-President of Doe Co. as of May 18, 2003.

I am a small business owner supporting five full-time employees and my own family of six. I am also a member of the middle class, which bears the largest share of the tax burden, and I am not opposed to paying my fair share. I have carefully studied the Uniform Tax Bill and I believe it would equalize the burden. The argument that those with the highest incomes would not pay their fair share simply does not hold up with this legislation. I request that you use your considerable influence in support of this Bill. Many of us are generating support at the local level.

Though you have not always voted the way I wanted, you have always responded to me. I ask you now to support the Doe Bill that is before Congress. This bill will increase the financial security of millions of Americans. It will do more to increase the savings rate in America than anything done in the last 50 years. Ultimately, the increased savings will lead to higher tax revenues in spite of what the opposition would have us believe. I appreciate your time and effort and strongly urge you to support this important legislation.|I am writing as a private citizen and outdoors person to urge you to vote for the Doe Bill coming before Congress this fall. This bill will increase the scant enforcement of laws regulating timber sales on public land in the upland areas of our state. In addition, it makes the timber companies more accountable to the people for the damaging methods of harvest they employ in sensitive areas. I have seen illegal clear-cuts, and I have seen slash burns destroy thousands of acres of wilderness, with no restitution made to the ultimate losers, the public. Big Timber may have the money now to fight this legislation, but with the support of forward-thinking public servants like you, we can work toward balanced, long-term solutions to our land use issues.|I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed Senate bill which would give a tax break to students who are pursuing postsecondary school training. As a small business owner I know how important education is to prepare young people for the rapidly changing world around them. And, as a parent of three, I know how expensive supporting children in college is, especially if more than one is enrolled at the same time. I believe we can make no better investment in America's future than to help our young people get the education they will need to succeed in the 21st century. Please vote in favor of this bill.|My business is located in your district and I have been one of your supporters throughout your term in office.

Because of all the growth in the last year, the traffic at that intersection has increased tenfold. Drivers become frustrated waiting for an opening in traffic to make a turn. It's just a matter of time before someone dies trying. Please have a traffic light installed at that intersection before it's too late. You will be the most appreciated councilman in Springfield, if you do. Thank you.|"I would like to register a complaint regarding the ridiculous traffic enforcement practices adopted the last three Thursday evenings at the intersection of Main and Elm streets in Springfield. On Thursdays Doe's Tavern holds an informal ""Cruise In"" and sells tacos at half price with the profits donated to a variety of charities. The participants, owners and admirers of customized cars and motorcycles, enjoy the weekly event because of the opportunity to show off and admire the vehicles in a friendly atmosphere. On the last three Thursdays, however, Springfield's finest have blocked Elm Street at Main to all traffic from the south. This is done, the officers say, to prevent backups at this intersection. The roadblock necessitates a long detour around the north side of Springfield, and the backup created by the roadblock stretched much further than it ever did before this enforcement began. The resentment and tension among the Cruise In's participants is an unhealthy byproduct of this silly policy. The weekly event has existed for over four years with a minimum of problems; there have been more confrontations between motorists and police as a result of this enforcement than in the last four years combined. I would very much like to see an official review of this enforcement practice. Look specifically at the efficiency of the roadblock. If the police wish to shut down Doe's Cruise In, let them attempt to do so through viable, straightforward means."|I am unsettled by the city's lopsided enforcement of animal control laws. It is common practice for pet owners to be cited and fined for walking their pets without a leash, regardless of the pet's level of obedience. Yet, if a neighbor's dog is penned up cruelly in a yard and barks 24 hours a day, the owner faces no penalty, even in response to multiple complaints to city police and animal control officers. I would like to see a better system of response to complaints of barking or menacing dogs in the neighborhoods. Please see that this issue is discussed in the next City Council meeting.

It is a weak attempt to address an immediate need without considering long-range goals. How much longer will development take precedence over the environment? When are we going to realize how valuable and irreplaceable the unspoiled landscape is? You have always been a champion of the underdog. Now the environment needs your help. Please vote against the Wilderness Bill.|I am writing as a private citizen and outdoors person to urge you to vote against the Doe Bill coming before Congress this fall. This bill will decrease the already scant enforcement of laws regulating timber sales on public land in the upland areas of our state. In addition, it allows the timber companies less accountability to the people for the damaging methods of harvest they employ in sensitive areas. I have seen illegal clear-cuts, and I have seen slash burns destroy thousands of acres of wilderness, with no restitution made to the ultimate losers, the public. Big Timber may have the money now to support this legislation, but with the opposition of forward-thinking public servants like you, we can work toward balanced, long-term solutions to our land use issues.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

We would appreciate your help in determining when he is to appear in court. Thank you for your help.|In the last several years there has been a tremendous increase in the number of homeless citizens sleeping in Doe Park. On any given night I can count at least ten individuals quietly sleeping under trees and on benches. The problem is that the park restrooms close at dusk, and the homeless have no toilet facilities. On behalf of the over 200 neighborhood residents who have signed it, I present you with this petition requesting the city to install and maintain a sanitary, temporary toilet. This measure, while not solving the problem of the homeless, will help address the sanitation problem this neighborhood park faces. I am sure you will see the logic in this request and will implement this measure until the greater problem of homelessness in Springfield can be fairly and properly resolved.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

There are far too many individual traffic situations needing attention to enumerate them all, but I would like to draw your attention to a particular intersection. The corner of Main and Center streets in Springfield is fraught with danger for the dozens of grade school children who cross these streets every day. Without a traffic light and crosswalk there, it is only a matter of time until tragedy strikes. Please pay special attention to this situation before the new school year starts.

As your overtime hours have increased, we too have come to realize the unreasonable scope of your present job description. After adding six typesetting projects a month to your regular editing workload, we have decided to hire an assistant unit manager to relieve you of several administrative tasks.<br><br><br><br><br><br>While this assistant will alleviate much of your burden, we still plan to increase the number of monthly typesetting projects in your unit from 12 to 18.

Specifically, we plan to transfer two editors from Eric Doe's unit to yours. You will be responsible for training them as part-time typesetters over the next three months. If you can have them up to speed by May, we will then begin expanding to eighteen projects a month.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We will need your continued feedback during this transition phase and expect to consult with you frequently. Above all, we are eager to see your daily workload confined to a manageable number of hours.

I must agree that the situation is a difficult one.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I suggest that you start off by speaking to the entire group about the problem without singling out one individual. If that has the desired result, you need take no further action, but if Mr. Doe persists in this behavior, you will then be able to speak to him privately, reminding him of what you said previously. This way, you will still have the option of using the grievance process later if it becomes necessary, but you will have at least tried to minimize confrontation between the coworkers. In any case, I am confident that you will be able to handle the problem with tact and diplomacy!||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Doe, the largest employer in Springfield County, with offices, production plants and warehouses in both Springfield and Centerville, employs over 20,000 persons. The freeze will act in conjunction with several internal reorganization measures set to streamline management in all salaried divisions.

A company analyst states that the hiring freeze should last no longer than three months, the amount of time allotted for the completion of all the steps of the reorganization. Volume, quality and pricing of shipments leaving Doe's plants will be unaffected by the changes.

I wouldn't know where to turn if I didn't have you. You are this girl's dream come true.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish you could feel all the passion and all the love that I carry around for you. You have won my heart and soul. You have won it all. You make me feel like I am in heaven--in the arms of an angel. You and I have a fulfilling relationship, but as it goes on, I wonder which is it--friends or lovers? That is not certain yet. We've been friends for a while now, but the friendship isn't just that anymore, at least for me. I have fallen in love with you, and I need to tell you that I am your soul mate masquerading as a good friend.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
641|Love|Confessions|A reason for living|I was sent down to earth on a mission, a mission to find someone that would complete me. I never thought that my task would be fulfilled till the very moment that I met you. That's when I finally found the perfection that I had been seeking all my life. At that very moment, I didn't believe my eyes as the girl that I had thought only existed in a fairytale was now standing in front of me. Each night, as I stood staring at the moon, I saw your gentle smile, the smile that gave me the strength to make the impossible possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My love for you grows each and every day. I am totally addicted to you, and you are the only drug that keeps me functioning now. When I look into your eyes, I see the real me, a person that lives for a goal and a purpose now. I pray fervently each day that you and I can be in a relationship that will grow to be more than friends some day. For now, I've written this letter to declare my love for you and to tell you that I am here waiting for you now.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
642|Love|Confessions|Be mine only|I don't really know how I can express my feelings to you, because I wasn't myself the first time I set eyes on you. I have seen and met great beauties in my life and have also learned how I could gaze at them just once and walk away. But with you, everything has changed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I believe you will understand me. I want to keep you as a flower I'm charged with looking after. Being with you is like being in paradise. I will take this responsibility seriously, if you are mine and mine alone.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
643|Love|Confessions|Beautiful love|"My beautiful love, you are my sunrise and sunset. You are my world and you have been since the first time I saw you from afar. My heart leaped in my chest and the vision of you made me catch my breath. Your hair was lightly blowing in the breeze, and the sun was bouncing off your face, making your eyes sparkle like stars in the midnight sky. I felt love the first time I looked at you, and my world became a beautiful place to live in. I often ask myself, what in the world would I do without you now? I hope to never find out the answer to that question.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My love, my beautiful love, come and answer ""yes"" to my proposal and make me the happiest man in the world! If you love me, too, then marry me! Come spend eternity with me! I promise to do everything to make you happy."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
644|Love|Confessions|Could it be?|I remember the day we met. You stole my heart and made it skip a beat. You have been the highlight of my life ever since then. When I sleep, I dream of you. When I work, we work together. When your heart beats, mine beats with yours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We have been friends for some time now; not one day has gone by without my thinking of you. And when I do think of you, the biggest smile comes across my face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I feel warm all over, and my heart skips a beat whether we're on the phone or just in the same room. Sweetheart, just looking into your eyes makes me remember the first day we met. I have the same dream we both want, and that is for both of us to fall in love with our best friend. I fell for you so long ago. Do you feel the same way about me?|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
645|Love|Confessions|Describing true feelings|I am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life, and I don't regret telling you how I feel.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have been through many relationships, but didn't really take any of them seriously. I was used and abused by a guy who I really loved once. So I decided to play guys the same way that guys had played me. I wasn't born nasty; a guy made me this way. Since then I have not taken chances with a guy again. But you happened; you came into my life and stole my heart away from the day I met you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At first I was confused. I didn't really know what I wanted. I didn't know if I wanted to take a chance again and actually take you seriously. So, I decided to come close to you as a friend and find out who you truly were first and what you were really like. You seemed cool, nice, and funny--some things I really liked in a guy. So I took a chance and got together with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the beginning, things didn't seem to go very well. I actually had my doubts about you, and I wasn't sure you were actually taking me seriously. But it was too late to turn back. I had already fallen for you from the day I first met you, and I wasn't really looking forward to giving up so soon. I tried so hard to know you. I wasn't going to let you go so easily!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Well, time has passed, and I have discovered new things about a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, I'm scared, because I'm growing a deep feeling inside my heart that I just can't explain. I truly don't know what your feelings are, but I don't want to force you to tell me something you don't really feel towards me. I want to receive love and trust from you when you truly mean it. All I ask of you is to show me that you care for me, and to also trust me the way I trust you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
646|Love|Confessions|Dreaming|You've got me dreaming about you now. I think of you every second of every day. I can't help it; you have become a part of my world and it's a little scary because I haven't depended on anyone like this for a long time. I would trust you with anything--with everything. I pray that you never do anything to make me regret this. Yes, now I can honestly say that I love you and will always love you because we seem to be soul mates. You say that we were meant for each other and I know that it's true because you say that you love me too.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
647|Love|Confessions|Embedded within my heart|Right after we met, my love, I should have told you this: there's this special love that I have deep within my heart. That love is only for you. It is far greater than this world. I wish I could show you how much you really mean to me. If I could only let you feel how much I really do love you in a kiss or a hug, you would begin to feel the love that I have for you. I will only be able to show you how much I really do love you when we get married. Then you will really know how much I love you. You can hear the sound of my love, though, just by listening to my heart. You can taste the sweetness of my love in a kiss; you can feel it in my embrace.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If I could describe the love that I have for you and use lyrics of love songs and even the sonnets of Shakespeare, it would still be impossible, because the love that I love for you cannot be put into words. You've had my love from the day we met, and you will have it forever. As time goes by, my heart and love for you will keep growing stronger, brighter, and bigger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Call me your love from this day forward. You are fully mine, as I pray I am fully yours. Although we have two different minds, and souls, we have one and the same beautiful heart. My love is unconditional.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you with all my heart, body, and soul. I will never stop loving you. You are my life, my world, and everything to me. Distance may keep us apart, but you will always and forever be embedded deep within my heart.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
648|Love|Confessions|Every morning|I wake up every morning thinking of you and then I roll over and see your smiling face. I know we can disagree, and I can make you mad, but you still love me with everything you have. I was scared to love you at first, in fear that you would hurt me, but I did anyway, and it's the best choice I ever made. Now, the only fear I have is waking up and rolling over and finding out you were only a dream. If this is a dream world, Baby, then don't wake me up because you're the one and only for me. I love you with everything I have and would give you the very clothes off my back. I love you with all my heart.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
649|Love|Confessions|Flame in my heart|"My heart is hungry for your love, but my mind is aware of what it cannot have. I know we belong to different worlds, so then why did you come and change everything in my life? I thought I didn't want to love again. I thought I wouldn't be able to because my heart has been hurt so much. To even say, ""I do""--it's a scary thought, but you came along, and I suddenly became fearless.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's hard to explain myself or to put it together in one idea; the only easy course is my loving you. For just one look into your eyes makes everything in the world and in my life seem to glow. You make me want to see the sunrise every day, to know it's another day where I could have you by my side. I know faith can make this work someday if I just keep my hopes up. Until then I'll think of you just like now. Your touch will forever caress me with tenderness, and your kisses will keep the flame in my heart alive. I hope that one day soon you and I will be together again."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
650|Love|Confessions|Found in dreams|"My darling, sweet Prince--where do I begin?<br><br><br><br><br><br>As always, I want to start by saying, ""thank you."" I tell you a million times a day, each day, that I love you and that you mean the world to me. Although you reciprocate some of these feelings, I'm sure you have no inkling of the strength of my love. My love for you is strong!<br><br><br><br><br><br>You walked into my life a stranger a mere eight months ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You are TRULY my gift from a higher power. ""Love"" is such a small word for what we share. You are amazing. You came into my life when I was at a low point: a time when I thought that the pain brought on by someone else would never end. During the moments I tried to turn away for fear of the unknown, you dug your heels into the ground and looked deep into my soul and stayed. You compromised your life and your goals to help me survive, and I owe much to you. Without you I could not even go on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You have become a beacon to me. Whenever I feel as though I've drifted too far into the discouragement that clouds my life, I can look up to find you guiding me to safety. I stay here, not because this place is home, but because YOU are home.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After all that's happened to me in the past three years, I swore that I could never settle down again--that I could never give my heart and life completely to someone again. With great content and zero disparity, I take it all back.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Most people will spend their entire lives searching for a perfection that almost never exists. Most people will spend their days looking at each person they encounter with questions as to whether or not they have found a reason, a season, or a lifetime. With you I have found an eternity. This is where I was meant to be. You are what my entire life has led up to. You are my very best friend, my lover, my protector, my teacher, and my one and only soul mate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I give my life to you--mind, body, and soul. I want you to hold me for the rest of my life as you do now, each and every night.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I belong to you from this moment on."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
651|Love|Confessions|From an admirer|I wish I could read your beautiful mind and see if you really love me. I know I love you with all my heart, but I have no idea if you feel the same way. My heart is ready to split in two because I need you, and yet I don't know if you need me. Please, from the bottom of my heart, I confess my everlasting love to you and hope that you feel the same way. Please give me an answer.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
652|Love|Confessions|Grateful love|"Baby, I don't even know where to begin! From the first time we talked to each other, I knew you were special. Words cannot even express how I felt the first time we met. It seemed so natural, like we'd known one another for years. Truth is, it's been just under six weeks. I never knew I could feel this strongly about someone this soon, but you proved me wrong. Every time I see the beach or a sunset, I think about that night. Actually, I think about that day and night all the time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's hard for me to tell you how I feel, because no one in my previous relationships has wanted what we have. And if they had, I was afraid to tell them I cared because I was afraid of being hurt. Please bear with me, I'm working on it. I will slowly be able to tell you how I feel and what I'm thinking.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I read this quote today and it's made me think: ""The best way to love is to love like you've never been hurt."" That fits my situation 100 percent. I kept dwelling on the past and what everyone else has done to me. After reading those words, I realized I cannot be with you and be happy and still dwell on what other guys have done to me. I am with you--not them. I need to concentrate on making you happy and letting you make me happy. Up until this point, you've been different than any other guy. I know that you wouldn't hurt me, at least intentionally. That's why you are different. I know you care about me and want to be with me. I am sorry I have doubted that before. There has not been a moment in the past six weeks when I have doubted my feelings for you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You've walked into my life and totally turned it around. I was so depressed and torn up about what had happened to me in the last year or so that I was ready to give up. You gave me the hope that I needed to keep on going. I am so grateful for having you in my life. I've been waiting for someone just like you to walk into my life. Thank you for everything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One last thing before I go. I have wanted to tell you something, but have not been able to bring myself to do so--<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
653|Love|Confessions|Greatest love|Every night when I close my eyes, thoughts of you fill me with joy. Every morning when I open my eyes, you're the first thought on my mind. I am certain that I am in love with you. I want to hold you, kiss you and to feel your body near me. If you'll be mine, you'll make me the happiest woman in the world. If you turn me away, I don't know if I can take it. But either way, you'll always be the greatest love I've ever had.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
654|Love|Confessions|Hidden feelings|I love you so much, and you don't even know it. Sometimes I get scared about showing it. It feels like when you come around me, my mouth locks tight, and the words I want to say are just stifled. My lips lock up because my love is so strong, and the words that I want to say just can't be expressed. Sometimes I want to open up and tell you how I feel, but I guess I'm just too scared. I know you love me, and you have feelings hidden inside, too. It seems like it isn't any easier for you to express yourself to me, than for me to express myself to you. I love you, so please know that I always will.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
655|Love|Confessions|How much you mean to me|I don't know how to start, because I'm afraid it might be the end of our good relationship or, if I'm lucky, it could be the realization of my dreams, which is for you to love me as I love you. I told myself, I might as well take the risk because it's the only remedy I know of that could let loose this feeling I've been keeping inside me all this time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you. I know you'll find it hard to believe me if I tell you how much you mean to me. I hardly understand what I feel for you, and don't know how these long, sleepless nights, thinking only of you can go one. I've never felt like this before. I don't know how to pour out my feelings for you now. I wanted to find the perfect words to make you realize how much I need you and love you, but words continue to elude me; what could they be? Something poetic? I'm sure it should be heartfelt and out of the ordinary. I'm afraid it's no use. Every time I look at you, the words come out the same--I love you!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
656|Love|Confessions|I am patient|"Our road to friendship has been a little less than conventional, but it has worked for us. I know you will always be there for me. That's one of the reasons I think I may be falling in love with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know you do not have time for a relationship right now and that you may even be afraid to commit to me, but I am patient. I will be by your side, regardless of my status with you. I have never felt so attached to a person in my life. I love talking to you or just being around you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I also realize that it is hard to tell somebody that you do not love them as they love you. Please, don't ever be afraid to be honest with me, because I will always be your friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Mainly, I wanted you to know I will wait for you. I don't need fancy gifts or all of your time. All I need is to know you care, and I believe you do already. I love your hugs and encouraging words, and I want to say, ""thank you"" for everything. I have loved you as my friend for a while now, and I would love to love you even more."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
657|Love|Confessions|I confess|I've kept my feelings for you contained as long as I can. I am in love with you, and true, honest love should not be contained and kept quiet forever. There is so much about you that most girls don't see. They only see the physical. They see your body, but my love for you is more than skin deep. My feelings for you grow every day, and my love grows deeper with every passing minute. You mean so much to me. Just seeing your smiling face or hearing you heart-melting voice brightens up my worst days and makes them more than just bearable. Just having a hug from you makes me feel warm and cozy inside. I dream of you day in and day out; you're the only one on my mind now. I am in love with you and have been in love with you since I can't remember when!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
658|Love|Confessions|I know it's you|When I was a little girl, I dreamed of that one person with whom I would share my dreams, happiness, and life. I could not see his face, but he was there. I always felt he was out there. I just needed to find him. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage he would give me to get through life's obstacles. All these years that I have been with others, feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person I am now. I've been sad and alone. Then one day I saw clearly that he was finally here. Here in my world was the man that I had dreamed of and had hoped I would not miss meeting in life--that man is you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
659|Love|Confessions|I need your 'Yes'|"This letter is my heart-template in which my burning feelings for you will finally be expressed. If you can remember, I sat by your side at the Public Library, only two days ago.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I really enjoyed the special moments I spent with you at the library. You struck me as being mild-mannered and sophisticated. In fact, your elevated words added some seasoning to my life. Sitting by your side that day, I was totally captivated by your charm and good looks. If you noticed, I was not wholeheartedly doing the assignment given to me. You were my total preoccupation, believe me. I wondered why I should ever get carried away by somebody I hadn't met before. Are there any particular things that I was hungry for that I found in you? I don't know. I just quickly realized how exquisitely beautiful and unique you are. Your long, wavy hair, tied back with a ribbon, really intoxicated me. I must confess, I have fallen in love with you, my dear. I watched myself slowly gravitate towards you. Since that day, it appears that our lives can be like the lives of the world's famous lovers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>To me, you're a rose that should be protected from thorns, a delicate angel who needs a defender. To be your defender, I promise that I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy and keep you safe.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm serious when I say, ""I love you."" I usually rhapsodize about your outstanding natural beauty to my friends. Your beauty hit me with a force of a poetic sledgehammer. I love you and cherish you. You're an angel personified.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm longing to wrap my arms around you to soothe my aching heart. I just need you to say, ""I do."""|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
660|Love|Confessions|I really love you|You are the only one who can make me happy with your love and affection. Since I met you, I have noticed that life is worth living. I live mine just for you. You have stolen my heart from me. Alone I am lost. Please, do not let the distance between us become larger. Each day is more wonderful than the previous one, if I spend it with you. The closer you get to me, it seems the more I love you. A heart truly in love never loses hope but always believes in the promise of love, no matter how long the time and how far the distance. There are so many ways I want to tell you that I really love you. My feelings for you are true and pure, like your kind heart. I have tried many times to confess this to you, but you always turn a deaf ear to what I say. Remember one thing--I love you and will always love you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
661|Love|Confessions|I remain yours|I have lived for a long time, responsible for and dependent upon no one, answering to no one and committed to no one except myself. During this period of my life, I considered the world mine for the taking and truly believed that I was living life to the fullest. Then you came into the picture and, all of a sudden, I realized that I was deceiving myself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I find that my life is not all that I thought it was. In fact, it is terribly lacking in many things, the foremost being love. Now, through some great fortune, I have found that love and, along with it, the one person who can make my life truly complete.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are that person, and I have fallen in love with you. To be honest, I never thought I would ever utter those words, but now they come forth effortlessly and with great sincerity. I'll be forever grateful to you for showing me just how shallow my life was. At last, I have a chance now to give it depth and purpose.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Until I hear from you, I remain totally yours in thought and spirit.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
662|Love|Confessions|I still don't know|"I just hope you read this letter. You know I've tried every other way to tell you how I feel about you except using the phrase, ""I love you."" I'm doing this to avoid you being embarrassed. I can say I'm not 100% sure you feel the same way as I do now. Maybe the distance between us now is making things more difficult. I do believe, my love, that if by coincidence you read this mail, you know I am saying this to you: I love you and always will. I can't help but tell you this."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
663|Love|Confessions|I wait no longer|I have spent my life waiting--not living, not loving, just waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to all my possibilities, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime, but I will never be alone. You brought to my cold, empty heart a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over. I love you with every ounce of my being. Yours is the first name I call out in the morning, and the last one I whisper at night.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
664|Love|Confessions|I want you to know|Every time I see you, I think I'm out of control. I do not know why I am feeling this way, but it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. I'd like to touch your face to see if it's real. How could I not notice until now that your face could launch a thousand ships?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'd like you to know that I love you so much, more than I have ever loved anyone. I just want to stay with you while I can for as long as you'll let me.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
665|Love|Confessions|I'm in love!!!|I don't know what happened to me, whether I was crazy or just lonely. All I know is I was sick of being deceived, mistreated, and unappreciated. Then you came along, I don't know why. All I know is that I felt a connection on our first chat, something I had never felt before that at first made me feel uneasy, stupid, and even a bit childish. It put me go through all kinds of emotions as we chatted on line and I began finding we had a lot in common. I felt like we knew each other from an unknown past.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At first I was scared, and a part of me wanted to believe that you were just someone who was playing a game. I was thinking I was crazy to have the feelings I was beginning to have for you. I was really upset with myself and became very angry with the way I was feeling. I didn't want to admit to you or to anyone else that I was falling for someone I had never actually met. I thought I was becoming insane myself. I tried to fight these feelings off, but they were just too powerful for me to ignore! I tried to convince myself that this can't be for real; that you couldn't REALLY be feeling the same as I was. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't fight the feelings I was having for you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Then the night came when you expressed how you were beginning to feel that which I tried not to believe, because I was scared of being disappointed. The magnetism that I was feeling was so strong, though, that I could no longer fight it. Our chats became an every day thing, and the feelings just wouldn't go away, no matter how hard I tried to ignore them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I just could not resist the temptation of meeting you while I was on vacation near you. All along, I could not believe you were for real, but when we finally first met, I knew there was no way I could stop loving you. I thought that if we met, these feelings would just go away, but they didn't. I tried so hard to convince myself that there is no such thing as true love, but you have made me believe differently.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We have been together for nearly nine months now, and I still love you and even more so now. You have become a part of me that I will always cherish. I love you with all my heart, forever and always. You have brought me so much happiness.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
666|Love|Confessions|I'm so in love|I'm so in love. I get this warm feeling every time I think of you. When I sleep at night, all I dream about is you. I wish I could wrap my arms around you and kiss your sweet lips. I wish I could feel the warmth of you near me. I ask you to let me be the one you love; let me be the one you need.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
667|Love|Confessions|Impossible circumstance|We met at work and, in the beginning, you were just someone I worked with. Months passed and all of a sudden my attitude towards you changed and I started to think about you all the time. Our circumstances inhibit us from being together now, but I can't stop obsessing over you. I've never felt like this before, and I don't know what to do. I guess this is a letter recognizing my deep love for you, but at the same I wonder how it can be. I love you with all my heart, and today I have the courage to tell you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
668|Love|Confessions|Is it love?|Hey! I've noticed that you've been flirting with me lately. At least it seems that way. You make it obvious that you really like me. I know I really like you. I want to know if you like me as much as I do you. If you do, please tell me so. I wish that you would be mine and that I could be yours. If you think this is love, please tell me. I want you to be mine.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Every time I'm around you, you make my heart melt. My heart beats faster than a hummingbird's wings. I love you more than anything I know. You've got the most endearing smile in the world! I love you so much!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you and will love you forever. I hope you love me. If you do, please tell me so.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
669|Love|Confessions|Is it real?|I just had to let you know that these last two days without talking to you have given me time to think about how I really feel about you. I have decided that I am definitely, hopelessly, in love with you. What made me realize this is not because I think about you all the time, although I do. It was how I think about you. Not only do I think about how much I love you, but why, how much, and mostly if I deserve you to love me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It feels so lucky to finally be able to love you like I have been wanting to for so long. Your sweet lips leave me speechless with each tender kiss. What have I done to deserve this? And that is another thing I was thinking. It is a little too strange, I think, that we are so right for each other. Some might want to argue about it, but I have a few examples to offer those poor, misguided souls. Your smile is like a world-famous painting. When we kiss, it is like two lost puzzle pieces finally found after a long search that make the picture complete. When we hold each other, time seems to stand still. When I look into your eyes, I see the love in your heart. All of this tells me one thing--our love is true and real.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
670|Love|Confessions|Just friends...?|We can never be--why? Because we are just friends, really good friends, and you don't want to ruin that, but then you kissed me!<br><br><br><br><br><br>You said that it meant nothing, and that you have too much respect for our friendship. I could show you that our being together could be amazing. I don't want to hurt you like you have been hurt in the past. I want you to take a risk and learn that being together can be great!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that things could never be the same again, but that's what life is all about--taking risks! I could make you so happy, if you'd just let me try. There's more to life than just sitting around waiting for something to happen. We need to jump onto a good thing and let our feelings fly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you, and if you have not seen that by now, then you are blind. I used to think it was just your looks, but then I realized it's who you are inside that makes my heart beat at this pace. Just being around you makes my life worth living. You will be in my heart forever even if it's just as friends.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'll love you always!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
671|Love|Confessions|Keep you forever|Wow, I don't even know where to start. I don't know if you even think about me but you make my heart pound so fast that it's hard to catch my breath. When I think of us getting together, I get goose bumps all over. You're all I think about now. I've never had a love like this before or felt this way. I want to keep you forever.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
672|Love|Confessions|Let's be together|My heart has found its way to you with all my love. I want you and no one else because you mean everything to me. I think we should try and make this work. I hope you know you're the one and only one that I want. You're the perfect friend, and I hope we can and will grow to be more. I could never ask for better than what we already have. I hope you're feeling the same way because my heart is set on you and only you, Baby.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
673|Love|Confessions|Love is fire!|It has not been long since we met, but everything has changed in my life. I experience more excitement and feel like the happiest man on the earth. I also think about you all the time. It is not just at bedtime, or upon waking up, but at my work, when I drive, and at all times. Sometimes I sit and, without any reason, call your name out loud, until I realize that you are far away, and then I just smile at the sweet thought of you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I talk to you, it makes my heart beat faster, and I feel sweet feelings, unexplainable, not understandable. I feel your presence everywhere near me, your laugh echoes in my ears, your talks remind me that you really exist, and I want you as much as the roses would need their perfume, like wind needs its song, like snow needs its whiteness, like a little child wants ice cream. I did not plan to love you, it just happened.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The world has many beauties: some are lilies, jasmines, irises, roses; some were just simple, plain flowers; none of them attracts me. It was your innocent smile, your sparkling eyes. It was like lightening had struck me, it was like an angel had appeared to me. It was you and your love that made me what I am today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will love you as long as the sun keeps shining, the stars keep brightening the sky, the winds keep blowing, the snow keeps falling, and the flowers keep smiling. I humbly ask that you be mine.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Loving you forever,|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
674|Love|Confessions|Morning love|Every morning I wake up smiling, just because you're beside me. I listen to your breathing and feel the warmth and comfort of just knowing that you're there. My favorite part of the day is when you roll over and hold me. That feeling remains with me all through the day and lasts until the following morning when we do it all over again. I never want that feeling to end. So I write this to you to let you know of my strong love for you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
675|Love|Confessions|My friend|Since the day I first met you, you captivated me! The first time that our lips touched, you touched my soul.

I love you with all my heart!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
677|Love|Confessions|My heart's reconsideration|Perhaps you will be astonished that you are receiving a letter from me. I just want you to know that a letter is more eloquent than words. That is why these words will definitely speak for themselves. I am a little confused on how to erase your beautiful and charming face from my mind. The more time I spend with you, the more I like everything about you, and the more I want to find out all about you--how you think, how you feel, what your dreams are, and everything wonderful about you. If I could only do something just to persuade you to care for me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Everything I wish to do is more difficult because of this unexplainable emotion. I promised myself before not to see you anymore or to talk to you--just to forget you, but these promises never materialized. My admiration has still been bubbling within me these long, lonely days.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I may be able to fool others, but I cannot fool myself. I would be a great liar if I said that I'm not in love with you. No matter what you think or say, all I can say is, I really love you with all my heart. If you will give me just a little time to prove my feelings to you and that I deserve your feelings, I will work hard at winning you. I can barely endure the extreme anxiety and the sleepless nights I have experienced lately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since I met you, I felt I was living in a new and wonderful world--one full of love. The sun became brighter, the grass greener, and everything I do became more meaningful. You should remember that I will cherish you always. Such love, like everything worthwhile, deserves to be given attention and care in order for it to continue to grow. I hope you agree with me.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
678|Love|Confessions|My hopes for us|I don't know how to approach this with you in person. Every day I fight a battle with myself in which my heart says I should tell you how I feel, but my head tells me not to be stupid. It would just cause damage to our friendship, and that you wouldn't be interested. I am not totally discounting the possibility that my feelings could be reciprocated, but as I have had very little luck with you in the past, my hopes are fairly small.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know there is probably very little I can say to change your mind either way. I do feel that given the chance, this could turn into more, but I guess that would depend on you, and how you feel about me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't pinpoint what it is, exactly, that makes me feel that you do have some feelings towards me. Maybe it's due to the way that when I talk to you, how you nearly always look me in the eyes; so few people do that anymore. Your eyes seem to speak to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish I could vocalize my feelings to you, but my fears prohibit me from doing so. I think that by the time I finally gain the courage, you will have found the person you are looking for. My biggest fear is that if I would tell you, then I would see a look of fear or horror on your face that would break me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish I could tell you how every time you don't turn up for work, I fear that I will never see you again. When I see you, and sometimes you look down, I wish you would open up to me and let me into your life. I know it wouldn't be easy, but I still believe that I could be good for you, if only you could return my feelings. I know I may not be the best-looking man you know, and I don't have much to offer you financially. All I could offer you is my heart and soul.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I fear this will not turn out the way I hope, but I pray that it does. As I said before, you may never know the true extent of my feelings, although I imagine you have some suspicions what they might be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This may be a crush or an infatuation but, I swear to you, it does not feel like it. I have had crushes before, but never really felt the depth of emotion I do for you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope that if I can muster the courage to tell you how I feel that, whether or not you can reciprocate, it will turn out okay, and that at the very least we can be good friends. I do long for so much more, though.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

681|Love|Confessions|My wish came true|When we first met, I'll never forget how you walked over to me and just started talking and you made me feel comfortable. It started out with a great friendship that has lasted almost two years now. In that time, we've had a lot of good talks and good times together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After these months of knowing you, I knew that I loved you, and that I always wanted to be with you. I had wished so hard that one day I would have a chance to be with you. Finally, I got up the nerve to tell you how I felt about you. Now I can talk to you and tell you anything because I trust you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you so much, and my wish finally came true last Saturday, when you first said that you loved me. My heart lifted because it felt so good inside to finally hear the words I had been longing to hear. We had been friends longer than we had been boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm so in love with you now. I promise you this: I will never lie or do anything to hurt you. You make me feel good inside and so happy, too. It's amazing being with you because you're such an amazing person.

682|Love|Confessions|Now that I've found you|This is not a sudden urge that has prompted me to write to you. When I first met you, I was struck by your warmth and by your sweetness of manner and speech. It soon became difficult for me to shut you out of my mind. Your bewitching smile captivated my heart. The more I tried to forget you, the more I began to think about you, until it dawned upon me that I had fallen in love with you. I've gotten the chance to know you in our swimming class, and I want you to know you've captured my heart. I know this is not right for me to tell you all these things so soon, but I can't help it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After we parted company last night, I had wonderful memories that filled my heart as I walked along the path that led home.

There is so much more to you than that. I have liked you for a very long time now, but just never had the courage to say it to you. Well, that has all changed now, and I am going to say it. I really care a lot about you, and I would like to be a lot more than just friends. You mean so much to me. I mean, just that special smile when I'm having a bad day just brightens the day and makes it bearable. Or just to have you give me a hug comforts me.

Every time I think of you, I can feel the butterflies fluttering inside me. You don't notice me or the way I look at you; maybe it's because you only see me as a friend and nothing more. I wish I knew.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At night I lay in bed and dream of you coming to my door, pulling me to you and holding me tight. I imagine whispering in your ear how much I want you. I want you to hold me. I need to hear your voice. I imagine being wrapped in your arms and then pressed tightly against you. I want you to make me feel a part of you. Every time we touched, I would feel like we're the only ones in existence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But as I sit here, watching the sun drop slowly into the horizon, my heart sinks with it.

I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me. I keep thinking about these things and I realize they go hand in hand. This relationship is my future; it is what I want out of life. I want to grow old with you. I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever, and I really think I'm going to.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want us to walk through new houses, picking the one that would be just right for us. I want to see you walk around our house in a big t-shirt with your hair down and catch me staring at how gorgeous you are. I want you to pull the covers off me at night and then I would have to get even closer, if possible, to keep warm. I want to see you laugh like crazy at me when I do stupid stuff. I want to rub lotion all over your body because you were in the sun too long. I want to have a child with you and go through the experiences of parenthood with you. I want to see you and me chasing our little kid around the house, all three of us laughing our heads off and having fun. I want to hold you when you cry and smile with you when you smile. I want to fall asleep every night with you in my arms. I want you to fall asleep on my chest listening to the beat of my heart and know it beats for you. I want you to be the first thing I see when I wake up and the last thing I see when I go to sleep. I want to see your bad morning hair. I want to sit on the beach with you and watch the sun set, and I want all the people who pass us by to envy the obvious love we have for each other.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to see you walk down that aisle and I want to take your hand for the rest of my life. I want to spend all night and maybe the next day making love to you with an undying passion. I want to be forty years old and still make out with you like a young schoolboy. I want to cook a meal with you and totally ruin it and end up having to order take out. I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing--but at the same time everything--or maybe we won't talk at all, just grin at each other, realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to burst out laughing when you try to yell at me, but can't stay angry at me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to lay with you in front of a fireplace and keep the heat going long after the fire goes out. I want to take trips with you to places we've never been before and experience them together.

I want us to go and pick out the hot tub we want with the biggest grins on our faces the whole time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to hold your hand when you bring our child into this world.

I wanted to stare into your eyes and talk to your heart, but I was really nervous, so nervous that I just wanted to leave. But I stayed; you were so helpful and so genuine with the compliments you gave me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My mind worked hard thinking of clever ways to ask you out.

But my mind took over again, and I marched right out of the mall and into my car.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thinking of how much of a fool I am, I started to imagine different scenarios of rejection and acceptance. As I returned to work, I was clouded with thoughts about you. So, as my confidence built up, I asked God to close all the doors, take away all the distractions, and anything else that was not from Him. And so He did.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After work, I drove back to the mall, again the experience of meeting you, seeing your beautiful smile with those beautiful eyes, and your sweet voice. I hurried there and as I walked through the mall and into your store, you walked out--I knew it was a sign that you came from above.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So I caught up with you, nervous as can be, and gasped, ""I know this is sudden, but would you like to go get a hamburger?"" And, with an angelic voice, you answered, ""Yes!"" My heart started to pound and butterflies fluttered in my stomach. Joy filled my heart. I wanted to dance like a child, but my feel would not move. All I could feel was my heart pounding.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for the great time. Hope I can see you again soon."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
694|Love|Confessions|This feeling|No one in this world knows the feeling that I get when I see you. They have no idea what I feel when I hear your name or your soft voice. Nobody has ever made me feel the way you make me feel, and that is such a crazy feeling. All I know is that I want to grab you and be in your arms forever and forever and never let go. I want to kiss your lips and never stop--just keep on going.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Every time I think about you, it gives me more strength to carry on my life. It makes me happy to be alive, knowing that you've come into my life. All I know is that I want to be with you! And I hope that you, too, want always to be with me.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
695|Love|Confessions|To my sweetheart|I have known you for such a long time. This letter may come as a complete shock to you, and I apologize, but I must tell you the way I feel. Ever since the 3rd grade, I have been in love with you, and considering we are both 25 now, that's a long time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Girlfriends of mine have come and gone, but I always compared them to you, and no one could really compare. I have never known someone so beautiful, so giving, and so honest. I love being with you. I love the memories that we have shared. You're the only one who will ever hold the key to my heart. I've wanted to tell you that for so long, and I just couldn't find the right time or the right words. I love you--and that will never change.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are the most incredible woman I have ever met. You're so outgoing and so friendly--and you always have so much to say. You're so sweet, and your heart is so big. I have never met anyone with a heart like yours, and I love you for it. You're the type of girl that, when you walk into a room, all eyes fall on you, and everyone's heart brightens up. You're the type of girl that men dream of when they close their eyes at night. You're the type of girl that guys can't wait to bring home to meet mom. You're the type of girl who I dream of spending the rest of my life with.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope some day I gain enough courage to tell you how I feel, because losing you to someone else would devastate me.

All I want is for you to let me see your face at least once a day!<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's becoming hard to see you anymore because it inspires me so much, and I'm so very attracted towards you now.

697|Love|Confessions|Why can't it be?|This letter is prompted by the noblest of impulses, so don't misunderstand the message it is going to convey.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I met you, as if by a God-sent blessing, I thought that I saw a light of soft understanding. What had come over me? I never felt like this before. Yes, before I met you, I lived a peaceful life. I could come and go and feel no trouble. But now, I am disturbed, both body and soul.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Can it be my imagination, or is it that love has struck too deeply, and I must pay for what is asked of me? I have tried to restrain myself. I have tried to stifle my desires, knowing that I am not worthy. But love's orders are imperative. Who am I to battle the call of fate? I know that when I saw you, Cupid had marked me for his victim. Yes, it is love that has taken root in my heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let me console myself that I have loved you in name only, a way that lingers only in imagination, in a mere dream, in fantasy, the creation of my lonely heart. Here I am still longing for your attention. I love you!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
698|Love|Confessions|Will my love be rejected?|It has been a long time since we first met. I can't believe how long I've loved you, and how long I have contained my love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The look of your eyes and that smile that you gave me melted my heart away. Those smooth cheeks--oh, I wished I could have kissed you right away. As soon as I saw your face, my knees weakened, my heart throbbed, hoping I could get nearer to you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I loved the way you looked at me the other day. My mouth felt numb, and I stuttered and I couldn't talk. I wished I had the courage to, though, because you're the most beautiful angel I've ever seen. I have been waiting years for you now. I hope I'll be able to talk to you soon. I just don't have the courage to yet.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for the smile you gave me. I really melted inside. I could say nothing, but just stared at your natural beauty. I wish we could go out together some day, and that we could have our nights by the beach. I would pour my feelings out to you then. Thank you for the feelings you awaken. No matter what happens, you are in my heart. I hope I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. That's all I need from you. I love you--that's my promise.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
699|Love|Confessions|Words I can't say|We have been friends for a long time now. Every day spent with you is like a wonderland of surprises. I've stood back, watched and listened as you told me of your past loves. If you only knew that there is a true love waiting for you--patiently. A hug from you makes me feel brand new. But these are words I'll never say, and so I will just sit back, patiently waiting; loving you in silence.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
700|Love|Confessions|You are special|Life is so unpredictable. Changes are always coming, big or small. I ask myself what is really special about you?<br><br><br><br><br><br>It might be all the things I see on the surface, the things that everyone notices and admires about your qualities, talents, and wonderful smile so obviously connected to a warm and loving heart. These things set you apart from everyone else. And it might also be the little things--the way you walk, the way you talk, and every action. It gives me joy just to see a smile in your eyes. If I ever figure out the magic that makes you so special, I'd probably find out that it's a combination of all these things. You are a rare person. I find you really amazing!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Inside me there is a place where my sweetest dreams reside, where my highest hopes are kept alive, where my deepest feelings are felt, and where my favorite memories are kept safe and warm. I find that you're on my mind more often than anything else. Sometimes I intentionally think of you just to make my day brighter. But more often, you surprise me and I find you in my thoughts. There are even times when I realize you've been a part of my dreams. Then during the day, when my imagination is free to run, it takes me into your arms and allows me to linger there, knowing there's nothing I'd rather do. I know my thoughts are reflecting the loving hopes of my heart because whenever they wander, they always take me to you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Only special things can come inside my heart and stay. And now, I realize how deeply my life has been touched by you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
701|Love|Confessions|You are like a dream|You are like a dream I never thought would come true for me. When I just hear your voice, I start to smile with joy. My eyes shine with joy if I even believe you are thinking about me. When you sing the song you wrote for me, it makes me feel as if we were meant to be together. You are so special. I pray we will finally know if we are meant to be with one another. I haven't even talked to anyone like you before. You make me feel special like no one has before. The things you do show me that you are such a caring person and will love me till the end of time. I just want to be loved and have someone love me in return, the way I've always wanted. I want to find my best friend, my soul mate, my lover, and my Prince Charming. I feel as if you may just be the one I am looking for and have been searching for all my life.

702|Love|Confessions|You are my everything|Hey, Baby, I know we haven't been dating very long, but I want you to know that I love you from the bottom of my heart. From the moment I first met you, I knew that I wanted you in my life, whether as just a friend or something more. Baby, I prayed for a long time to find someone like you--someone willing to fight alongside me, someone to make me smile and someone who would truly love me. You're in my thoughts, my dreams, and every breath I take.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that this is true love. I feel like I can tell you anything. You know things about me that even my best friend doesn't know now. You're always there to pick me up when I fall and to dry my tears. Thank you, Baby. I love you.|I never thought I could really love someone as much as I love you. We started out as friends, just talking, but over the last couple of months I've truly fallen for you, head over heels. You're not one who can admit how you feel, but I believe somewhere in your heart you have feelings for me, too. I know you would not have just wasted your time for nothing. You know I care. You're the only person who could ever put joy in my heart and a smile on my face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't want you to leave me. I told you, I'd wait for you if you got sent away and that's the truth. You said if that ever happened to me, you would wait for me, too. I hope that's the truth, too. I will always love you.

Now that I have met you, I go to sleep thinking about you, and the next morning I wake up smiling because I may see you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's amazing how you got me and won me. I never thought I could love this much, but I was so wrong. I just thank God for having found you. We were meant for each other, and no one can change that. I love you with ALL my heart.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
704|Love|Miss You|Across the miles|I know it is as difficult for you as it is for me to be separated for so long. Life seems to be full of trials of this type that test our inner strength and, more importantly, our devotion and love for one another. After all, it is said that true love is boundless and immeasurable and overcomes all forms of adversity. In truth, if love is genuine, it will grow stronger with each assault upon its existence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our love has been assaulted many times, and I am convinced that it is true love because the longer I am away from you, the greater my yearning is to be with you again. I cherish any thought of you, prize any memory of you that rises from the depths of my mind, and live for the day when our physical separation will no longer exist.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Until that moment arrives, I send you my tender love, my warm embrace, and my most passionate kiss-across the miles.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

It has been a little over 2 years now, and we are still deeply rooted in each other's hearts, minds, and souls.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Before we met, I had no idea what love really was and then my heart started aching for you. Now, each day we're apart, tears run down my face with longing to have you near me again. I never knew a man could have stolen my heart and made it truly his. I never knew I could love a man more than my own life until now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I long for the day I can finally look into your kind, beautiful eyes and tell you how much I love you and need you. The true beginning of my life will be when you are here in May. Seeing you every day will bring the greatest joy to my heart, knowing you are finally in reach of me. The very thought of you here excites me in a wonderful way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are my every heartbeat, my every breath of life. What I need to survive and make it through this lonely world can only be conquered with you by my side. I do not think there are any words that could describe the way I actually feel about you. All I know is that you, dear, are the only man that is on my mind, the only man that is in my soul, the only man who truly and unconditionally has my heart for whatever lifetime this world has to offer us. When I think about you, my eyes start to tear up because I know you are somewhere else and not in my arms. But the thought of you keeps me going for another breath of fresh air and will keep me longing for you the rest of my life. I will never leave you, and I will truly never hurt you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I admire you. You are my inspiration for anything and everything worthwhile on this cold, damp earth. I never thought my time would come to love, and then it came, and I was hit with so much emotion and power I did not know where to put it all. I have stacked it, piece by piece, in my heart for you. I truly believe you are my soul mate, and you are the only man I will give all I have to offer forever. I hope you never let go of me because I love you, and I trust you love me too as much as I love you. Sometimes I need to think about you to make myself happy when I am down, and just the thought of you brightens my day completely. Picturing your smile makes me smile, and I cannot wait to see the beloved man I know with his unforgettable smile. I treasure you, and keep you locked in the big steel safe of my heart.

Think of me and my warmth will be the blanket to help you sleep peacefully in the night. Look to the evening sky, and when you see a sparkle from a shining star, that's me, thinking of how much I love you and miss you.

710|Love|Miss You|Best thing that ever happened to me|I know we don't get to talk or see each other any more, but being apart for now doesn't change the way I feel about you. Sure I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed with this emptiness in my heart. Just remember that I love you and everything about you. That's what gets me through every minute of every day that I'm without you. Sweetheart, you don't know what I would give to kiss your lips, feel your touch, or even just to be you. I long to hold you and feel your sweet caress. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe but, more importantly, you make me feel wanted. We both knew our friendship would grow from the first day we spoke.

You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, and my true love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't care if you forget our first kiss or our first date, just as long as you remember that I love you with every aching bone in my body and always will, no matter what.

Do you know what it is like to see the song birds sing their sweet music, and yet not hear their sound? Do you know what it is like to know your heart's inside you, and yet not feel its beat? Do you know what it is like to be in a crowd of people smiling, laughing, sharing their love together, and yet be all alone with no one around? Do you know what it is like when the light of your life has been extinguished, and you are left in absolute and complete darkness, frightened and alone? Do you know what it is like when the one you love so deeply and dearly is so far away? Your heart cries out their name and yet there is no reply.<br><br><br><br><br><br>All you want to do is hold them in your arms, and you cannot. All you desire to do is kiss their sweet lips, and you cannot. You long to hear their soft sweet voice as they whisper words of love to you, and you cannot. You just want them near, and they are not.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Their absence brings with it frustration and sadness. You question God that you cannot be with the one you love, and yet you thank Him completely for bringing that person into your life, all the while knowing that no amount of dreams or hopes or prayers can change the situation-the situation that is in the hands of the God you trust.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So, what do you do in such times? How do you keep your wits about you? How do you maintain some semblance of normal life, when all you can do is think about the person that you are so much in love with and who you would do or give anything just to be with? You feel lost somewhere between the cruel reality of life, and the dream-like fairytale that you wish to live in, and the only salvation is to be found in the arms of your beloved and that cannot happen.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Friends cannot comfort your soul. Thoughts only make your heartache worse. What do you do? You pray to God for the strength to see you through this situation, knowing that you will never fully be the person you were before when your love was here.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The mind is a whirlwind as your thoughts are tossed around like leaves in the wind. But the one thought that is constant and eats away at the core of your soul is a simple one: ""When will I hear from you again? Will I ever hear from you again?"" Time causes such thoughts to occur, over and over. It is only human. I am only human.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And so, I wait. For how long? Only time can tell. As I wait, it seems as though the hands of the clock move in reverse instead of forward. Each second that passes seems an eternity away from you. Time takes you further away from me instead of bringing you closer, and time is something that is beyond our control.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh, to be an angel, and have wings that I may fly into your arms at this very second! To taste your sweet kiss and feel your warm embrace. To love you, to have the pain of needing you, all vanish in your arms, as would snowflakes on a summer day. And to know that we would at last be together for all our days. Days spent lost in sweet heavenly love, such as we have never known.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My darling, how is it that love can be so wonderful, and yet hurt so badly? Such pleasure in knowing and feeling your love for me, and such mortal pain in being apart from the one that I love so deeply, so dearly, so passionately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Darling, you know the old saying that applies to being away from someone important that goes: ""Out of sight, out of mind""?

We even manage to send e-mails and off-line messages.

Let me share a kiss with you as you read these words, my beloved. So many dreams have gone to waste for every moment we're apart, and all I ever have are the words from my own heart to send you. Let my pen draw you closer to me, my angel, so that I can clearly picture you on this writing tablet as I write your name on it, over and over again. No longer do I have justification for my own life, but your goals are more reasons now for me to utter a prayer for another tomorrow. I will soon be with you, my love. It may not be tonight or tomorrow, but I promise you, when you hear our song again-that will be the day we will be together again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am eternally yours.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
719|Love|Miss You|Hating the waiting|I wish I didn't have to miss you. If only you could be with me always, I know I could never be any happier. But then again, I know that the day will come when I will be able to spend my every waking moment with you, and I won't have to lose any more sleep over you. But then, I even miss you when I am sleeping because you are in my dreams! I love you, Babe. You are my first and only love. Hopefully, soon I won't have to miss you anymore. Blowing you a kiss--Whooo!|I do not like to be so far away from you. It is lonely, and I miss you so much that I cannot sleep. I want you near me at night so that I can feel your warmth. I feel safe and peaceful in your arms, and that is where I want to be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You say that you are missing me, too. Three weeks seems like eternity to me. I have marked a calendar and will cross out each day. There are twenty more to go before I will be with you again. Talking on the phone does help, so please keep on calling. I love hearing your voice, especially when you say you miss me and that you love me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But speaking on the phone and writing letters are not as wonderful as seeing your smiling face and holding you.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
720|Love|Miss You|I am fortunate|"I just want you to know that I am very fortunate and very lucky to have you in my life. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me. You made me very happy and you made my life complete.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The first time I saw you in person was the best time of my life. You are the one who taught me how to love again. You gave me so much love and happiness. Keep in mind that whatever happens, ""You are my one and only love."" I love you with all my heart and soul.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you, my love, for loving me and for giving me a chance to show you how much I love you and how much you mean the world to me. I know we're a thousand miles apart right now, but I'll be right here waiting for you, my love. I love you always and forever."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
721|Love|Miss You|I belong to you|From the day we met, I knew that you would hold my heart in your hands and you do that now-you completely own me, every part of me. When I think of you, my heart is so full of love and desire for you that I can hardly contain myself. I want to spend every minute of every day with you and know what if feels like to hold you close to me. Whenever you think of me, please know that no matter how many miles separate us, you are, and always will be, the love of my life, and I will never love anyone as much as I love you again. I thank heaven every day for letting me meet you and for falling in love with you because I know that love could never be perfect any other way. I love you with all that I am.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
722|Love|Miss You|I love you so much|You don't know how much I love you! You are the best boyfriend any girl could ever ask for. Whenever I have a problem and need some comfort or advice, you are there for me. It is you who I want to spend the rest of my life with. I want to have your children one day too. You don't know how much I appreciate you, admire you, trust you, respect you, and unconditionally love you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I believe this is true love, and you are the one for me. Being away from you drives me crazy and makes me want to be with you right at that very moment. When I think of this separation as a test, then I can deal with it. If this is what it takes to finally be with you one day, then I will go through it. Well, Honey, I am going to end this letter by telling you that I love you more than anything in this world. Remember that for now. I love you so much.|I love you with the deepest passion and I wish we could see each other every day but I know that you're so far away. It hurts me to know how I sometimes can be a little selfish when it comes to you, but, Girl, I'm in the deepest love for you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Did you know that I think about you at night wishing you were here? I love you, my beautiful Purple Queen. I want you to know how I feel. We really need to talk but then again I don't know. My heart bleeds blood for you and I can't see. My stomach hurts and my head is throbbing but I want you to know more than anything that I miss you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Forever in love with you,||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
723|Love|Miss You|I will love you until my last breath|"How are you, my dear, are you tired, are you ok? I always ask you lots of questions, not because I just am curious, but because every question comes from inside my heart. We are so far apart from each other, and I try so much to be with you. This is difficult, but nothing on earth can make me lose my true love for you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although we've never met in person, I still truly love you. I don't really know when I first started to love you. Maybe it started with sending e-mails back and forth every day, opening with a ""good morning"" or ending with a ""good night"" with a lot of feeling. Then, one day, I found myself loving you and couldn't stop that feeling. Just knowing you more and more each day, and seeing how you understood everything I did, I started to love you more and more. Every time you say ""Hi,"" you brighten my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Distance is a problem now, but if we look at it from a different point of view, we will know this is the thing that can only prove our true love, not end it. It won't be long before every dream will come true, and we will smile with a tear of happiness together. We'll talk about the past in our home together with our little daughter who you wanted to stay with me-the little girl who has black hair like you, blue eyes like me, and your smile. I wait for the day we are together again, as I know you do too. I love you with all my heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
724|Love|Miss You|I will not forget you|Many times I have thought that life was so unfair. I know there are reasons why we can't be together. Reasons that no one knows, but they will not affect my love for you, and I will not forget you. You really don't know how much I love you and care for you, but there is nothing more I can do about it now. Even though we're apart, this will not be the end of our commitment. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Always remember that I really treasure your love for me. I truly love you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
725|Love|Miss You|I will wait for you|I know we can't be together right now, we're just too far apart, and I understand that. I also know that logically you will probably never actually see this letter, either. But the same part of me that knows we will be together always, regardless of the way things are right now, believes you will somehow find this letter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you with every part of my being. I love you wholly and selflessly, and I know I am nothing without loving you. I will wait for you always, and I have loved you since the day I met you. That night in my car, in the first ten minutes when we got to know each other on the way to that party, I knew you were the right one. I had been hurt so much before, I didn't think I even believed in that fairy tale of love anymore, but you made me believe in it again, without even knowing it. I know now that somehow we will be together always, and I will one day be with you again. I look forward to nothing more than spending the rest of my life trying to make you as happy as you make me. I love you more than words could ever say, and with that I end my love letter to you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
726|Love|Miss You|In love with a soldier|As the day fades away and the night slips upon me, I find myself clinging to my prayers for comfort. Every night I pray to God that he will keep you in His arms. I pray He will keep you out of harm's way until we can finally be together again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Sometimes, it seems so unfair that they kept you longer than they said they would. I realize, though, when you love a soldier you cannot expect life to be dependable. You asked me what I wanted to do about us. Well, my love, I do not want our relationship to end, that's for sure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Just because we will not be able to see each other for a long time is no reason for us to give up hope. If you really love someone, the time and distance apart should not make a difference. Two years is not that long--relatively speaking. I will continue to wait for you. I wouldn't care how long I had to wait. I would wait forever, if that's what it took. So now you have my answer. I love you. I hope you feel the same way I do.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
727|Love|Miss You|It's our turn|Many years and many miles have kept us apart for so long that it is hard to believe we have found each other again. Now we must make time disappear and miles grow shorter. Our love started at forever and will end at never. It's our turn to make each other happy. We have grown older and matured rapidly; let's spend the rest of our lives together. Through trials and tribulations my love will be true, so please know that I am there for you, whenever you say the word. I understand that there are many things to be worked out, many things that need to change. I just don't want to waste any of the valuable time we have left together. I love you with all that I am.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
728|Love|Miss You|Last hope|I am still wondering if I am dreaming or what? How do I deserve all of this love? What is it in me that makes you treat me so kindly? I can't get any answers!<br><br><br><br><br><br>All I know is that I am thankful you have come into my life and made me feel so loved! I keep hoping that this will never end. Being loved by you is the only thing I need now. When you hold me in your arms, I pray that the moment will never end! I need you once again to show me there's hope in love. Thank you for that. I am missing you terribly now. Tell me what I can do to bring you to me now, to fall into your arms, to hear you say you love me and to see your smile when you look at me. Thank you for loving me and, last but not least, I love you too! I really do.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
729|Love|Miss You|Love comes in many ways|Never did I imagine that I would ever meet you, especially in the form of a chat friend. A year later I am leading my life as your fianc, which I never would have thought of this same time last year.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Fate has got her own reasons for us to meet and come this far, but I hope our love will continue to flourish, even beyond the depth it is right now. Distance may be the reason we sometimes think we cannot handle this relationship, but I am sure our love for each other is stronger than we know.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am writing this letter now to tell you that my love for you is so real that I can't find the right words to describe my feelings for you. At the same time I would like to thank you for all your patience while our relationship went through high waves and over hard rocks. My love for you has grown so strong that I could never imagine a life without you now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will always be yours, no matter what challenges the world offers us. My heart will always yearn for your love and care. I will love you forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
730|Love|Miss You|Love sent from above|"Since the first day you told me you loved me, I could hardly believe it. As each day passed and our love grew stronger, my mind did not lose the wonder of having you love me. You've stayed with me through all the ups and downs so far.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I may not be the surest of men, always knowing what to do, or the right decisions to make, but I learn quickly. I want this to last. I don't want our love to burn out because of my mistakes. I believe God has sent you to me, and for that I thank Him from the bottom of my heart. You are truly a blessing in my life. You've taken my heart and wakened it from a deep sleep. I see how much you care, and I feel like I can fly. You are lifting my heart and inspiring it with yours, and it's the best feeling in the world.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I sit here, thinking of you, and how I love you, and how you make my heart beat. I could never have thought that I would feel this way about anybody. I just love you so much. I don't know how it happened, and frankly I don't even care. I just want to have you in my arms again, to love you, and to have you love me. I promise I'll love you forever and never leave you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This may be starting to sound like a poem, I don't know; it must be the rhythm of my heart that's calling for you. I just want to tell you and the world that you are in my heart and in my every thought. I love you with everything I have and hold dear. You mean more to me than anything, and I miss you so much. You're probably sleeping now, but when you wake up, this will greet you. I'm pouring my heart out to you in this letter. Can you feel how I feel for you now, my one and only love? You mean the world to me. I'll always be faithful and never leave you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've done what I've wanted for so very long now--I've told you how I truly feel about you. But once I press this ""send"" button, you will know how deeply I love you, my angel. I'll hold you in my heart forever."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
731|Love|Miss You|Miles apart, Together at heart|I know you will never read this, but I want everyone to know that I love you with all my heart and soul. You make me feel like I can fly. I'm in love with you and, even though I am thousands of miles away from you, I am forever by your side.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You have imperfections just like everyone else, I'm sure, but that is why I love you. You make me laugh; you make me cry tears of joy. I truly could not live my life without having you to talk to and to confide in. You know more about me than anyone now. You know my thoughts, you know my heart inside and out, and you have a way of making my heart skip a beat, too. I want you and the whole world to know that I love you and that I will be yours forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for showing me what kind of love all women deserve, but most never have.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
732|Love|Miss You|My declaration of love to you|The feelings of love that I hold in my heart for you run deeper than any ocean or sea. I just wish you could know how much you mean to me. If only you could hold me, then maybe you would feel my love and how it burns for you. If only you could hear my heart beat, then maybe you would understand the language of love it speaks to you. If only you could kiss me, then maybe you would taste my love for you. If only you could look into my eyes, the window to my soul, then you would know how true and honest my words are to you now!<br><br><br><br><br><br>If you want me as your true love as much as I want you as mine, then let it be. I give you my heart and ask nothing more and nothing less than that you don't break it. My love and trust are all I have to give to you, sealed with honesty. As time goes by, may they grow stronger and fulfill whatever your heart may desire.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If it pleases you, call me your love from this day forward, as I call you mine. I am your love and your best friend, too. As our bodies, minds, and souls combine, so do our hearts become one.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Hear this, my declaration of love from me to you. I love you, my angel, with all my heart, and I will never stop loving you. You are my life; you are everything to me. Though distance may keep us apart for the moment, you are embedded deep within my heart.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
733|Love|Miss You|My destiny|From the very first moment I saw you across the room, I knew you were my destiny. No man had ever captured my attention so fully or made my heart skip a beat the way it did that chilly February night. Your smile lit up the entire room, your laughter was delightfully contagious, and your mere presence warmed my heart and soul. I had no doubt you were the man God made especially for me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to thank you for that late night talk in the rain. You might have thought it was crazy then, but now you know it has ensured our future with an everlasting memory. Thank you for the conversation on the recliner in the sunroom and for asking me to be yours that night. Most importantly, thank you for falling in love with me and making me your wife. No matter how quickly our courtship passed, I know that standing before God and family and vowing to be your partner for life was the easiest decision I ever made.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After only ten days as man and wife, we suddenly found ourselves divided by thousands of miles of sand and sea--separated by your service to our great nation and a war that could not wait. We've been apart for over seven months now. Each day that passes me by only makes my love for you grow stronger. Though we may struggle through our separation, please remember my love for you knows no boundaries and will continue to stretch across any ocean and over every grain of sand between us to get to you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I may be your wife, but you are my life. No war or distance can ever keep me from my destiny. I miss you so much, and I will be here with open arms when you come home to me where you belong.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Loving you now and forever,|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
734|Love|Miss You|My eternal feelings|I think of you all the time. You are so far away, yet so close in my heart. My heart and my body yearn for you. I love you unconditionally. I accept your daughter, who will become mine, and any other little ones that will come from us. For the first time I have purpose. For the first time I have found a family.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have read all about you and your zodiac sign and it is a good one. You are perfect for me. You excite me so much. I look forward to each day, so that I can come there and spend time with you. Last night I dreamed of you--I could picture you with me and it was so vivid. I hope I will always be yours. I am truly lucky to have found such a dear, sweet, loving person as you, an Aquarian, not just a woman, but a beautiful, sensual woman who arouses thoughts of such unbridled passion in me, and the desire to give myself to you completely. I remain yours forever. Time will pass and I know we will stay together.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
735|Love|Miss You|My love is pure and true|I know sometimes we fuss and fight. I know sometimes things don't go right. I know sometimes I can frustrate you, and sometimes you get me mad. I know that you're my better half. I know without you I'm incomplete and that tomorrow you won't be here with me, but you know that no matter what, you will always have a key to my heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We might be miles away for a while. I might not get to hear you laugh, or even watch you sleep but, Darling, did you know that one true test of love is distance? It is said that distance brings people closer together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that even if I have to shed a tear every day until you come back, I will. If I have to hide myself from the world, I will. I will do anything I can just to make sure that when you come back to me you will know that my love is pure and true.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
736|Love|Miss You|My love will reach any distance|You are a blessing that my entire being is thankful for.

I will love you eternally and unconditionally. I miss you more than words can say, and my love will reach any distance to be in your heart each day we cannot be together.

I believe in you and have faith in you and in our future together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I Long to see you again.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
737|Love|Miss You|To men and women in the military|I am counting the days till you come back to me and you are in my arms again. The days seem longer than usual since you went overseas. I know that I should write only cheerful letters, and I will try. I do want you to know, however, that you are sorely missed. Your parents and I stay in touch. We talk about how we will welcome you home when your tour of duty ends.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We all pray that you are kept safe from harm and get the mail and packages that we send you. I would like to wrap myself in a box and mail myself to you.

You took my heart at a glance, and I knew you were the one I wanted to spend forever with. That smile of yours just put me in a daze. I am so happy I have you in my life. I couldn't ask for anything else in this entire world because I found all I ever wanted or needed in you! The times we shared together are times I will always cherish! I am looking forward to all the happy moments together we will have in the future!<br><br><br><br><br><br>The day you had to leave to go overseas is also a day I will never forget, because that day, my love, you took with you my heart and soul. You looked at me with that smile on your face and promised everything would be fine--you said the Navy put us together and would keep us together until the end of time! We held each other tight with tears in our eyes. We didn't want to let go, but the time came to say goodbye. I hugged and kissed you and told you, ""I love you."" You held me so tight that day and looked into my eyes and said, ""I love you, and I will come back to you."" I got in our car and just sat there, and the tears wouldn't stop. I looked up from the steering wheel and surprise! You ran back to me! You kissed me one last time and said, ""Believe me, I will be back.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>This is a cost I know I have to pay, my love. I know there will be other times you will have to go away, and the pain will not stop until I have you back by my side. Fight for our country, then hurry back home to your loving wife! I love you and I miss you!"|We all want you back again, safe and sound. You are serving your country, and I am proud of you for that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss your kisses and your arms around me. Every day I miss you more and more. I hope I can see you again soon, but until I do, I will keep you in my prayers and in my heart. Remember that I love you and that I always will. We are the lucky ones because we found each other again, and we are able to love each other more than we ever have before. I can't wait to see you again. It's only been a little over a week, but already I know that I cannot be away from you and from our love so long. I love you with all my heart!|I wish I could speak to you every day, but the times you do call or when we get a letter are wonderful! Talking to you makes me feel good for at least a day or two afterwards, and I read your letters over and over again!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I appreciate it when you try to cheer me up. There you are serving our country in the middle of shocking events and still you try to make me feel safe! You are unbelievable and so special! I will love you always.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please take care of yourself and don't worry about me.|I am really proud of everyone who is serving in the armed forces. It makes me feel good just to tell people that I know you. You and thousands of others who stepped forward to defend our nation are brave and honorable citizens.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please let me know if there is anything at all I can do for you here. I would be happy to visit your parents if you like. Just let me know.

We love you and miss you here at home.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After I call the children together to pray every night, first we look at the family picture we had taken before you left first. Then we fold our arms and ask God to protect you and bring you home soon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please take care, my love. Everybody misses you here.|Neither one of us expected to be separated this long. We knew you could be sent away to fight in that war, but neither one of us really thought it would happen. But now it has, and I am so lonely without you, but proud of you, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you very much, but the career you've chosen is an honorable one. I don't think there is anything more important or worthwhile than protecting your family and defending your country. I know you feel that way, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We love you and miss you so very much.|Oh, how I miss you, my wonderful sweetheart! The military has taken you far away from your home and from me. Yes, I do get lonely, but I think of how difficult it is for you there, and then I scold myself for being selfish.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please don't worry about me. I am okay. I want you to think only of taking care of yourself and of coming back home soon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you very much.|You don't need to worry about me and the kids. We are fine except for missing you, and we will go on missing you until you come home again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have my job to do here taking care of the children, and you have your job to do there, which is just as difficult.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I worry about your commitment to defend our country during these difficult times, but I really am proud of you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The kids and I love you and miss you, so please take care of yourself.|I realize that we can't be together, but I will be here for you when you return. In the meantime, I know that you are in God's hands and that He watches over you. I pray every day and night that He will always watch over you. I miss talking to you and listening to your voice. I miss your hugs, your kisses, and your sweet ways of showing how much you love me. I have never been in love with anyone the way I am in love with you. I feel free when I am near you. You let me be me and make me feel so special.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know God has something good in store for us, because He is a loving God. When we are in each other's arms again, He will shower us with His incredible love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you and our children miss you, too. Our son and daughter talk about their Dad every day. We include you in our nightly prayers, which we say with your photograph nearby. We all talk about how we will shower you with hugs and kisses when you come home. We sometimes argue over who will run up to you first when we see you at the station. We all agree that we will spoil you and never allow you to be out of our sight.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With God watching over you, we know that you are in the best of hands.||||||||||||||||||||||

My love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time. I am just at a loss for the right words when it comes to you.

When I awoke this morning to see if it were real or a dream, reality hit me that it was only a dream. Very soon, though, I know you will really be right next to me, and that I will not have to only dream of it again because you will be right there so we can hold, hug and squeeze each other tight. I long to be there with you now, so that I can help build and support your life there, and so that we can accomplish a lot together as husband and wife.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

I am so amazingly happy and content when I'm with you, I want to spend forever in your life, in your world, in your family, and in your arms.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
741|Love|Miss You|Now that you're gone...|You came into my life not too long ago, and I didn't think too much of it. We were friends and we got along well, but I never imagined I'd be falling so hard for you. The more I got to know you, the more often I wanted to be with you. You always made me smile, and without you I was very different. You changed me in so many ways. I wanted to wake up in the morning to see what life was going to throw at me each and every day. After we became closer and were talking all the time, you told me you had to leave. You had to go back home, and you couldn't stay any longer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>That night I thought about telling you what lay within my heart, but I decided not to. Your friendship meant so much more to me. You are coming back to visit soon, and I can't help but think about you all the time now. Every morning when I wake up, then during the day, and before I go to sleep, you are always on my mind and even in my dreams. I wish you knew how strongly I felt and that I am falling in love with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One day I will tell you, but for now I will only see you in my dreams and hold you close to my heart. I love you so much. I can't wait to see you again!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
742|Love|Miss You|Once in a lifetime|Where would I be if I hadn't met you? I'll tell you where--I would still be lonely, looking for that special someone to make me smile again. We found each other at just the right time. If I had met you earlier in life, I don't think I could have appreciated you as much as I do now. Everything that I have been through in the past year has only prepared me to meet you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The distance that is between us now is only going to make our love stronger, so there is less of a chance that we will take each other for granted. The weeks that we are apart, I look forward to the day that we will be together again. I am already looking forward to the next time that I get to see your handsome face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The love that we share is never-ending and powerful. I thank God every day that someone loves me as much as you do. It is a once in a lifetime thing! I love you and the way you make me feel. I love you with all my heart and soul. The great thing is, I know you love me just as much as I love you, and your love is true and not to be taken lightly.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
743|Love|Miss You|One day...I promise|Honey, you have changed my life completely. You're the one who makes me beautiful. You're the one who makes me strong. You're the one who makes my life so important. You're everything to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You show your love to me every day and even every minute when we are chatting. How lucky I am to find a man like you. Thank God above for us! Honey, please forgive me for not being able to spend enough time chatting with you now, but I promise I will compensate for it one day with the thing that you want the most. You know what I think that is? A family. A family that belongs to us; a family who we can share our ups and our downs with, who we can stay together with till we die. Honey, that's the best I can give you. I hope it is what you want the most.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I really wish that you were near me, and when I need help, you could appear and help me. I want to do the same for you, too, but knowing that you love me is enough and, if I can be your wife and your children's mom, then this would make me proud for the rest of my life. Remember, you need to take care of all of us, so you've got to take good care of yourself too. Ti Amo tesoro mio, you're the only one that I want.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
744|Love|Miss You|Only the beginning|Happy anniversary! I'm writing this letter to remind you that I love you. I know that things have been a bit hard for us lately, and we have both hurt each other, but I really do believe that it will be okay now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you more than I can say. You are the most important thing in the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You make my life complete and I am only happy when we are together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that we can't be near each other at the moment, but if we just put up with being apart for a bit longer, it will all work out, and it'll be worth it in the end. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want us to grow old together. I hope this is only the beginning.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
745|Love|Miss You|Our hearts are linked|Remember, our love is the link that holds our two hearts together. If I could put into words how you make me feel when I think of you, and how much you excite me when I hear your sweet voice, I would be talking forever! You're all that I need and want, Honey. I live for the day that I can sit next to you and whisper into your ear and tell you that I love you, and kiss you ever so lightly, but passionately, on your lips, and to look into your beautiful eyes as you take my breath away. I live for that first look into your eyes, that first passionate kiss, that first embrace, and that first time that we make love together. I live to love, to spend a lifetime with you as your wife and to grow old with you, loving you for all time, from now to eternity. I love to love you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
746|Love|Miss You|Our hearts beat as one|What further words can describe what we have together? For our love to grow as it has this past year, I fed it with every beat of my heart. Words can no longer describe it, only the feeling and emotion we have for each other can express it now. You have always had the key to my heart, and your spirit inside my heart has made me more than I can ever be. Though the sea separates us till that special day, I know we take each breath together with every beat of our hearts. I love you with all that I am.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
747|Love|Miss You|So close, Yet so far|"Our love started over the Internet and everything seemed almost perfect then. We had never met, but the love we felt was so big and true, even then, and could only become complete by meeting each other.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The very first day I saw you in person, we said, ""hello,"" immediately felt the thrill of that love and held one another so tightly. We didn't want to let go, and time stood still. We had a perfect day, and we knew it could only get better and better if we held, kissed, and hugged one another. After that moment, we never went through a day without saying how much we loved and needed each other and would for the rest of our lives.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Being far away from you is difficult. Not sharing every day with you and not being able to hold you whenever I want hurts so much, but I know that at the end of all this pain, I will find you again. You stood by my side when things were good, and when they were bad, you listened and hugged me saying, ""Everything's gonna be okay."" And it was.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we'll have a great life together, and I can't wait for us to be with each other every day now, sharing everyday problems and joy, without having to leave one another's side. Fate is putting us through this, but we'll come out of it all shining, as the love we feel for each other is hard to find.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm proud of the person you are. I love the way you treat me and everyone else. I'm proud to be with someone like you, the sweetest and most caring guy I've ever known. Don't ever change, Honey, as you're perfect--we're perfect for each other and it will be like this for the rest of our lives."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
748|Love|Miss You|So far apart|"I am just writing you to let you know how much I love you. We have many miles separating us, but I know we'll make it through. You mean the world to me, and no one can ever compare to you. I think about you all the time, and wake up thinking of you and go to sleep thinking of you. Your name repeats over and over in my mind. Your very name, Matthew, means ""gift of the Lord,"" as you have actually been to me. Each day my love grows stronger, so I know my love for you will never fade. These miles between us won't fade either, but I know that our love will keep us together. It's so odd for us to be so far away from each other, but yet so close in spirit. I love you, Babe."|The sadness I have is really indescribable. Your moving so far away because of business is the worst thing that could have happened to us. It is as though a large wedge was put between me and the person that I care for the most. I am fighting the existence of this great distance between us, and it strikes me hard because I miss you so very much. Not seeing you often and knowing you are many hours, not minutes away, breaks my heart. I don't like the distance and just thinking of the many days before we see one another again makes me cry.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I write this so that you can read it when you, too, feel lonely. I love you with all my heart and soul. All that I am, I owe to you. You are with me in spirit every moment of each day, and I hope that you feel my loving presence where you are.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
749|Love|Miss You|So real|"When we first met, I didn't even consider that you were real. You were just a pixel on a screen. We talked more, and then I became confused. ""How I could I have real feelings for a person I've never met?"" I'd ask myself. Since then we have met. I will never forget the first time I looked into your eyes, and it was at that very moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. In your eyes, I saw everything I needed to know. It's been seven months now. Things have not been easy. We've had our ups and downs but, through it all, I do know what we have is so very real."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
750|Love|Miss You|Something special|Although we've never met, I feel as if I know you well. I knew from the start that there was something special about you; you touched my heart and haven't let go of it. Our relationship has given me a lot of dreams, and now I feel hope. You entered my thoughts and magically erased all of my fears with your sweet and caring ways. Now I look forward to each day and feel so much at ease with you. I'm so grateful that we're able to share our problems and aspirations with each other. It truly seems as if you're a part of me now, as if our time together was a union of souls. The thought of you fills me with smiles, and I can't wait to hug you each day.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
751|Love|Miss You|Stormy times|Being apart from you again is like feeling death in slow motion. I think of how things could have been, if only we had gotten married. But what can we do about it now? Pray for peace. I'm lost without you and can't think about anything but what our destiny could be. Suddenly, I close my eyes and imagine your hands caressing my face, fearing that you'll feel the tears running down my cheeks. I know you're hurting as much as I am, but I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I love you, and I'm not sorry for loving you. You have given me so much happiness, and I know you love me now in your own great way. I miss you so much, and the fear of losing you is driving me crazy. Don't let our love die because of the distance, nor let our faith fade away. I'm waiting for you to come back to my arms, and make the sun shine once again on these stormy times.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
752|Love|Miss You|Surviving time|I know we don't get to talk much anymore, but being in Florida doesn't change the way I feel about you in my heart. Sure, I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed with this emptiness in my heart. But I love you--that's what gets me through every minute that I'm without you. You don't know what I would give to kiss your lips, feel your touch, or even just to be near you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't care if you forget our first kiss or our first date, just as long as you remember that I love you with every aching bone in my body, and always will.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
753|Love|Miss You|Sweetest sin|"From Day 1, I knew there was something in you that no other guy has. I had always searched for a blonde-haired, blue-eyed man, and dreamt of having a fairytale wedding. Well, you don't have blonde hair or blue eyes--but I think you're perfect! From your gorgeous smile to your warm, loving eyes and strong arms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was scared to love you after everyone said we wouldn't even make it for two weeks, but we did, so what do they know? After we passed those first two weeks, I knew there was something that just worked between us. We made it through the best 10 months of my life, and then that's when you left. Now you are 2000 miles away and I can't be with you until June. Although these will be the hardest months of my life, I would wait forever to be in your arms again. Once again, we have people saying that there's no way we will make it through this, but I think we can prove them wrong once more.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I live for you, and only you. I dream of the day that I can be your wife. I want so badly for that dream of mine to come true; you have no idea. When we talk about getting married and having kids together, my heart melts. I know that I'm young--younger than you--and you want what's best for me, but I know in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You have taught me so much about myself and the way that I should live my life. You have taught me things that will eventually help me grow into the type of person I need to be, and you have taught me to love without holding back. You have been my ""sweetest sin"" since the beginning.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My parents didn't want us to last, some ""friends"" didn't want us to last, but you have no idea what it's like to be me when I get to feel your hands caressing my body. It's the feeling I get being that close to you, the feeling that I am the safest person in the world. I love you! You are the one for me, but you know that already, and I'll say this until I turn blue in the face: Marry me! You know I don't even mean right now, just some day! I love you!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

I know it's only been a week since we met online, but I feel like I've known you forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Every time I chat with you, my heart skips a beat, and you take my breath away. I love you so much already, and we haven't even met in person. I understand that you have a very important job to do but, when I don't get to chat with you, I feel so empty. I miss you so much.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I long for the first time that you will hold me in your arms. I know it will be an experience that we both will enjoy and cherish for the rest of our lives. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and no one else.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Every time your name is mentioned, my face lights up, and I get a smile on my face bigger than Dallas. I know us being apart like this is a challenge for the both of us. God is seeing if we can make it, even though we are apart. If we can stay together until we can really be together, then there will be no one who will ever be able to separate us. I love you with all my heart and soul.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am so glad my friend introduced us to each other. I had a good feeling come over me when I first saw you on my computer screen. You are a very handsome man. You take my breath away every time I see you, and I feel deep down that this relationship is going to work. You promised me that you would never hurt me, so I am going to hold you to that promise.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Love is a very powerful word. When you tell someone that you love them, you have to truly mean it from the bottom of your heart. I have this feeling that you really, truly mean it from the bottom of your heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are the best thing that has ever come into my life. I have been hurt so many times in the past that it takes a lot for me to trust someone now. The first time I saw you, I had this gut feeling that you and I were going to be together for a very long time. I love you. Please don't ever leave me. I hope I'm not over-burdening you with all these lovey dovey talk, but I do love you, and I need to tell you that. You have me forever if you want me.

756|Love|Miss You|The hardest thing to do...|"It has almost been one and a half years since I had the honor of holding you in my arms, and it has been one and a half years since we looked into each other's eyes and said, ""I love you.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>What started out as a sincere friendship turned into a strong bond between two lovers who found out the true meaning of love the hard way. The journey seems so long, sometimes, and at the same time it seems so short. To me it feels like time is purposely bending and stretching itself so that it can play its part in making us feel the joy and pain of what it is to truly be in a long-distance relationship. All I know is, as time goes by, I learn a lot from this love, and I have learned what it is like to give myself completely to another person when the two of us are so far apart. The most important thing I learned, among many important things, was to trust and to be faithful to the one I love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I just got done chatting with you on the Internet after you had signed on to say ""good night,"" but in my heart I did not want to do that--say ""good night,"" that is. I just wish that time had frozen that short time before we had to say those words. I enjoyed every single moment with you, and how we talked about all of the things we liked and disliked. Tonight you told me how you liked the music CD your brother bought for you, and you asked me what music groups I liked, too. I really wish I could have been there to hear that music with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am sitting here in my room and writing this message now, hoping you will get to read it when you come back from work later if you go online, but if not, then at least I know this letter will reach you sooner or later. I am listening to some love songs that I burned onto a CD I'm making. Although I don't understand the words because the songs are in Spanish, I know that they are about love, and I like them a lot. I really don't understand how my love works, but all I know is that the love I have for you is just like the Spanish music I am listening to now. I know that my life is much happier when you're around me and that my life is filled with music just thinking about you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to let you know that I am so in love with you, and I have learned a lot from this relationship. I promise you that I will do my best to make you feel loved and secure, even though there are thousands of miles between us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for making my life so much more meaningful and giving me this chance to tell you what love means to me. I know that I am supposed to go to sleep soon, but there is so much more I want to tell you, and I am still so wound up. Being away from you is so hard for me because it is like giving up a part of my life that is essential to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have built my world around you, and I really like the world that we have built together. I always want to stay in that world and never want to leave it, and I hope that you feel the same way, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now is the hardest part for me to do. I have to say ""goodbye"" and ""goodnight,"" because I need to go to sleep soon. But I know that as soon as I close my eyes I will be there with you, and it makes me so happy again. I love you with all my heart, and I want you to know that I really miss you. Please take care and have a nice day tomorrow.

760|Love|Miss You|This long distance love of ours|"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever believe this could ever happen. I never expected to fall so deeply in love so fast. It all started last week with your first email to me: ""Call me, we need to talk!"" I was just online trying to catch up with some friends, and I had the pleasure of seeing your email message in my mailbox. I wanted to wait a few days before calling you, but my heart had other plans. So I called you a few hours later and that was the beginning of this love affair to remember.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember we talked for hours about anything and everything. When you asked me to come to NYC to visit, I was scared at first, but again my heart spoke for me. I decided to take a chance and see what would happen, but I never expected we would say we loved each other even before we met in person. Now don't get me wrong--I believe in love at first sight, but I thought I would be the last person to be bitten by that bug. When you surprised me with a dozen long-stemmed roses last Wednesday, however, I received a confirmation that had been in my heart since Sunday--that I loved you. When you said, ""I love you,"" it gave me a little tingle in the pit of my stomach. Something I had never felt before.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When we saw each other Thursday night for the first time, I knew you were real and not just a dream that I hoped would come true. The time we spent together in NYC was magical and so romantic that I never wanted it to end. When you asked me to move to NYC, how could I say, ""No""? When you said you wanted me to be your wife, how could I say, ""no""? Even though we live apart right now, I have faith that in due time this will all come to an end, and we will be together forever. I love you more than words could ever show, and I know you love me too. Like the saying goes, ""Distance makes the heart grow fonder."" Well, my heart has always been and will continue to be quite fond of you. I love you more today than yesterday, and I will love you more tomorrow than I do today!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

I want you to know that I love you from the depths of my heart, and my love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time that I am at a loss for words to tell you so. I just wish that there was another way that we could be together without living so far apart at the time being.

It's so hard not to be able to write something to you every day. I want you to know that I always care about you, and you're always in my heart.

Please know that you are a big part of me and I think of you all the time. I love you, and I've loved you before I was born, because I believe I was made for you, and will be yours for all eternity.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
764|Love|Miss You|To those who wait|My love, you are so far and yet so nearby. You are many miles and many moons away, and I get lonely just thinking of the distance between us, yet in my heart you are just a beat away. When I feel blue, I picture you with me on a moon-lit night, holding hands and planning our great future together. I think of the good times to come when I will be embraced by your love. I will be patient, my love, because I know good things come to those who wait. Until then, I will love you, anticipating when you will arrive.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
765|Love|Miss You|What's your magic?|I'm pretty sure you are safe, because I'm always praying for you. I couldn't really believe that even in my wildest dream that things like these could ever happen to us. I never realized before that just one click of the mouse could really change my life. And I never expected to fall so deeply in love, so fast, with you. What's your magic? How pleased I am to be a meaningful part of your life. I'll always be in love with you--only with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we can't get together right now; we are just too far apart, and I perfectly understand that. But somehow, I still have faith that in due time, this will all come to an end, and we will be together forever. Being far away from you is not that easy. It's getting harder and is starting to drive me crazy and make me think about you, more and more. Although we're apart now, I can assure you that it doesn't change the way I feel about you. You're such a blessing to me. Thank you for everything, for loving me. I mean it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And one more thing--I really appreciate you. Maybe you are too smart to fall in love with me, but I guess I am much smarter than you are because I let myself fall in love with you so deeply.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
766|Love|Miss You|While you are gone|It's funny, because I told myself I would never fall in love again. Yet when I was the least expecting it, I fell the hardest (our second date in the park). I finally found my true soul mate. I know that the next year or so will be very hard on our relationship. I've been thinking about that a lot these past few weeks. The more I think about it, though, the more I know I have made the right choice. No matter what coming trials we may yet face, I will never give up on our love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I once was told that if you really love someone, then everything would work out just fine in the end, and that if our love was strong, we could make it through anything. Lately, I have realized that is what true love is all about. I want you to know that while you are gone, I will be completely faithful to you. Honey, you will NEVER have to worry about that. I know without a single doubt that God brought us together, and we were just meant to be. I love you and I will forever!|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
767|Love|Miss You|Wish I were there with you|You have no idea how long I've dreamed of the day when we could be together again. You truly can not imagine how hard this situation is for me. I've longed to be with you for years, but never really had the guts to do anything about it. That was until you actually approached me and from then on, I have been in love--not a crush, not puppy love, but true, honest-to-goodness love. The kind of love that somehow transforms you from one of those people who think that everyone else gets everything, to one of those people who is convinced they actually have it all.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Honey, I guess what I'm trying to say is that before you, it seemed that I had nothing, and now I feel I have everything. It is all due to you and you alone. Well, I should probably tell you now that I love you and miss you and that this has got to be harder than anything I have ever done--feeling so close to you, yet being so far away.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This is really hard for me because what I want to say is--pray for me and that this war will be over soon, so we can have peace, and so I can come home to you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
768|Love|Miss You|You are my world|"If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of this beautiful feeling that I have for you, I would have uttered them to you the first time I laid eyes on you. But I lacked that knowledge, so the best thing that I can do is to show you how I really mean it now. I love you so dearly. Did you know that? You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are like the best poetry ever composed, the best song ever played, the best picture ever painted. I never thought or expected that someone like me could get so lucky as to find you. How could I have known the comfort and security that comes whenever I say ""I love you,"" and you say the same words, too?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that you love me, or you wouldn't have married me. Marrying me was just among the many wonderful things you have done to show me that you are sincere and how much I mean to you. I love you more than life itself--more than my world. You are my world. Life wouldn't be life if I didn't share it with you. We may be far away from each other right now, but my heart and my love can reach across any distance, and I feel your love reaching me here, too. It just feels so wonderful knowing and believing that. Aren't we lucky? I love you--more and more each day."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
769|Love|Miss You|You are everything to me|When my sky turns gray, and the thunder starts to roll, and it seems as if tomorrow will never come, I turn to you. The look in your eyes, the touch of your hands, the sound of your voice--it's all I need to brighten my day and blow the rainy clouds away. You are my angel from above, sent to me. Why? I do not know, but what I do know is that I don't deserve it. When I look into your eyes and feel your gentle touch, it sends chills up my spine, sending me into an ecstasy beyond explanation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Babe, you drive me wild! Just the way you look in my eyes sends my head spinning and the stars start to shine. The sound of your voice starts my heart pumping so, Babe, you can only imagine what it's like when you wrap your arms around me and I feel your warm breath on my cheek. You make my body shiver in bliss, my breath is taken away, I see the stars, Babe, and it's all because of you. It's amazing how you knock me off my feet; every time you come around me, I get weak.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Dream maker, make my dreams come true tonight! If I close my eyes, will you hold me tight all night? Will you be here by my side when my nights are cold and lonely? Will you give me your love that I crave so deeply? I cannot imagine my life without you now. You are everything inside me that I wish I could be and so much more. I look at my life before I knew your love, and I don't know how I ever survived.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I said before, you are my angel, my miracle. I never knew that someone like you was out there, just waiting for me to find her. Well, I did find you, Babe, and now that I have you, I will never let you go!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Babe, just confide in me your deepest feelings, tell me your fantasies, and they shall all be fulfilled. I will do anything it takes to make you happy because that is the only thing that matters to me anymore. You are perfect in my eyes, and there is absolutely nothing that I would ever change about you. I know that no one can be perfect but you, Babe, in my eyes, are as perfect as anyone could be. It leaves me amazed, yet blessed, to have found someone as special as you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Babe, I'm going to be sitting here waiting; waiting for your phone call and then waiting for the day I will actually see you. A little distance between us is going to drive me crazy, but I know it'll all work out just fine. Till then, I will just be waiting for the day when we will actually be together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Hugs, misses, and butterfly kisses,|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
770|Love|Miss You|You keep me alive|You are so far away, and every day I wish you were here with me, holding me tight in your strong arms. Every night I lay in bed dreaming of you, sweet and peacefully. You are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. Missing you so much is breaking my heart. I need you to come back to me, my love. I love you more than anything in this world. I want to walk on the beach with you; then it would be so peaceful and romantic just to sit together and watch the sun as it sets.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Being with you makes me happy. You keep me alive and vibrant. I'm so lucky I found you, the man of my dreams. I hope I never lose you. If I did, it would break my heart. Thinking of you makes me smile because knowing that you love me means the world to me. You're sweet, like the smell of roses, and you're romantic, like the sunset.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am feeling down right now, and your love is all that is keeping me strong. I love you so much. I can wait to be with you physically for just another day, but not forever.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
771|Love|Miss You|You saw me|Since you came into my life, I have been so happy. The fact that we're a thousand miles apart is not a problem at all because you are always in my heart. You told me that I'm the right one, and I cannot tell you how good that made me feel. I am waiting for the days to come that will make our dreams come true. I'll wait for you for a lifetime if you want me to. Do you know why? Because you are the only one who sees me when I am invisible to others. I hope you never quit believing that my love for you is true.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
772|Love|Miss You|You warm my heart|You brought love and laughter to my sad, empty, and meaningless existence. My life had been boring until the day you came and filled my heart to overflowing with your sense of humor. You turned my frown into a smile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You taught me how to love again. You taught me to give and receive love by trusting in you and believing in us. You taught me to go the extra mile and, though there are miles between us, I never stop thinking about you. You brought a great change into my life, and my heart is yours forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can never forget you or keep thoughts of you out of my mind. I think of your sweet lips and kisses; feel them as if you were here. Thoughts of you warm my heart. You complete me and are everything my heart desires.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
773|Love|Miss You|You will always be in my heart|I could kiss you a thousand times and still not be satisfied. My love for you is endless, and so tender, and so complete. I love you more and more with each passing day, and it eases my mind to know as tomorrow approaches, that I will love you more tomorrow than yesterday, and tomorrow I will love you more than today. My love for you cannot even be expressed in words, but only when we are together and you are holding me tight.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I think of our love, it reminds me of all the things you mean to me. You and only you have given me so much hope and have made me realize how much I need you, too. You show the true meaning of how a man should treat a woman.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Rodney, please accept my heart as your own and listen to both of our hearts beating as one. You are my reason to live. Without you, I am nothing. The years will be a test, but nothing will keep me from loving you, or from being by your side. I love you more than you could ever know; you are my world. I just want to let you know how much I love all that you are and will grow to be. You are truly my love, my soul mate, and my best friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For the first time in my life, I have something to believe in. You've seen me at my worst and still take me as I am. I thank God for you every day because I know you are an angel who is heaven sent. I love you from now till death do us part.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Right now you live far away from me and it's killing me, but I know in my heart that we will make it through this. I don't want to lose you to anyone else or to anything that anyone has to say about me. I want you to know I love you from the deepest part of my heart. I'm always so lost for words when it comes to you. I just wish there was another way that we could be together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you and always will. There is nothing that will ever change the way I feel about you. I love you! Love can make a person do things that they never thought possible. There's a place in me where your fingerprints still rest, your kisses still linger, and your whispers softly echo. It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part me. I promise that you will always be in my heart. I love you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
774|Love|Miss You|Your ghost|"We immediately connected in a way that lifted us above all else. It was so passionate, yet so spiritually uplifting--that's what ""making love"" is all about. It's spiritual, yet passionate at the same time. That intellectual, genuine, true appreciation for one another that we've had since we first met was the purest form of affection I have ever experienced. Now it's gone, at least for now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have always been a very strong person but, as you can plainly see, I am hopelessly lost, like a little child that's been alone too long. On occasion, though, I can hear you in the house and, for a moment, like the poet said, ""All's right with the world."" I haven't thanked you lately for shining that light on my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Your ghost keeps me company for a few seconds every once in a while. I wake up in the morning, and hear you in the kitchen, or in the shower, or I can smell your perfume, but it's just the ghost again. But I thank God every time I feel it, because when I am apart from my one and only soul mate, I learn to appreciate the little things we shared, even more than before.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I believe that neither one of us really knew what true love could be until we met, nor what real passion was before we made love for the first time. We will make it through this now; we just have to trust one another enough not to be afraid of how overwhelming our challenges can be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are my sunrise and sunset, every single day. You are my heart and soul--never have I met anyone with your kind spirit and loving heart. I am truly sorry if I have ever let an opportunity slip by without letting you know how special you were.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will love you always."|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
775|Love|Miss You|You love me!|I feel like the luckiest person on earth because you said that you love me. Those words sent me flying, my head spinning, and all I can think of is you and when we meet again. On that day, I promise to cover you with caresses--and so many kisses that you will know of the love I have for you. My loving you will be something you will want to have forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How lucky am I? You are the most beautiful woman I have ever known. You are perfect in every way. You are special and kind and lovely, and I could not ask for more because there is nothing more that I would want or need.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We will be together soon. I count the hours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Your lover!|You can never ever know how I treasure the words in your last letter. You say that I have enriched your life and made you feel special. These words I will hold in my heart, which is already bursting with the joy I have felt since we have been together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you more than I ever thought I could miss anyone. That is no surprise to me, because I love you more than I ever thought possible. Somewhere I read that distance makes the heart grow fonder. That may be true for some, but for me, every moment, whether away from you or with you, makes me love you more. Every moment of my life is enriched because you love me and I love you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We have to be patient for a little longer. I am forever yours.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
776|Love||Can we start over? (Let's see if the magic is still there.)|As I opened my eyes this morning, I had a sinking feeling in my stomach that something was wrong. After a minute I realized what it was--you were gone. How long has it been since you left? Oh, yes, I remember--about five weeks now. Actually, it's been four weeks, five days and--let me see--about 10 hours. It seems longer than that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I look back on the way we were, we lived in our own private, happy world. When we walked close together and whispered to each other in public, the old people smiled at us and nodded knowingly, while the teenage girls pointed and giggled. When I went to work in the morning, though, some of my tired co-workers frowned, a little annoyed that I came in smiling and happy when they were facing another demanding day. But the work hours went by quickly, at least for me, and I always had you to come home to. We would always share the highs (and lows) of each other's day while we whipped up some chef's surprise in the kitchen, or went out and ate in style. And, oh, the nights we spent together afterwards--we shared our highs in each other's arms, too, remember? Sleep came easy for me back then.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since you left, though, my nights are restless but uneventful. I find myself turning sideways in bed, throwing an arm over as I try to cuddle up to someone who's no longer there. It was very cold for April, didn't you think? Breakfast often consists of cold pizza, left over from the take-out I had for supper the night before. Afterwards, I join my subdued co-workers in facing another lackluster day with not enough to look forward to at the end of it. I have no one who's willing to comfort me when my boss shoots down another one of my great ideas and no one to agree with me when I analyze the state of the world. I have no incentive to eat in the kitchen like a civilized human being and find myself chewing something indifferently in front of the TV.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What all of this means, of course, is that I still love you and that your leaving has left a great void in my life. True love is not easily destroyed, I've found, even when the once-happy lovers separate in anger. It was anger, wasn't it? Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. Whatever it was, most problems can be solved when those involved have had enough time to cool off and think about it. I don't know about you, but I've had all the time I need. Actually, I can't even remember the details of why we separated or who was to blame. It doesn't seem important now, anyway, and it certainly doesn't seem worth throwing away all the good things we've shared together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm half afraid to ask how you're doing. Do you miss me? I hope so. Is there a gap in your life that you haven't been able to fill yet? If so, stop trying to fill it and consider seeing me again. If you do, you will find an older and wiser person than you knew before, but I still love you just the way you are. I'm proposing that we go out to dinner and just see if the magic is still there. I could pick you up or just meet you somewhere, whatever you prefer. Let's go somewhere special--how about Tony Roma's? We used to eat there in happier days. Think about it. I'll call you Saturday afternoon and see if you're willing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember us the way we were.|"How are things going? I hope that you are doing well. I wish I could say the same for myself. Oh, my classes are going well. I never thought I would enjoy teaching at the U as much as I do. I do sometimes miss the excitement of deadlines and hot stories that comes with writing for a national newspaper but, in a way, this work is even more rewarding. Seeing the fire in my students' eyes as they come up with new angles makes teaching as exciting as any story I ever nailed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Much as I enjoy it, I didn't really write to talk about work, I wrote to talk about us. I don't know how these last months have been for you, but they've been terrible for me. I didn't know how much a part of my life you had really become. Before you came along, I had my fast-paced career and my friends, and a lot of casual dates, and I thought I was happy. Then I met you, and my whole world shifted. I never knew joy before like I knew in the year I spent with you (well, one year, eleven months, and seven days, but who was counting?). Now, the pain that I felt when we ended our relationship has only deepened.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The bottom line is that I'm still in love with you. I know that at the time we parted we both felt that a little time and space was the right thing for both of us, and I think we were right. Things were just getting too intense. Our pressures at work were really getting to us, weren't they? I had just become chief editor at the paper, and you were quickly moving up your own corporate ladder. We put so much into getting ahead, we stopped giving time to each other. It's no wonder that things didn't work out. I've decided, though, that what we had is worth too much to just give it up if there's still a chance for us. What do you think about starting over? Is it possible that, despite the time that has passed, you miss me as much as I miss you?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't know about you, but I've definitely learned my lesson. A career is a great, exhilarating thing, but it has no arms to hold me tight, nor warm feet to keep mine warm on a cold night. I can't curl up with a job to watch a gorgeous sunset or my favorite movies. It can't share my dreams, and it can't kiss me after a rough day and make things better.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I would love to get together to talk about old times. We could go to the Sky Room Restaurant for dinner, then maybe go for a drive and talk about old memories and maybe make some new ones. What do you think? I hope to hear from you soon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am ""your girl"" always."|I couldn't wake up this morning, but I had to. I couldn't eat; I forced down a piece of toast. My co-workers are beginning to comment on my appearance, but I can't seem to help it. I'm sad most of the time. I find myself looking at the calendar--sixteen days since you left (and counting). I dread going home to a dark and empty house. You're not there to greet me; what's the use?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I find myself slumped in front of the television with the mute button on. I sit on the same couch on which we used to watch movies and hold each other and kiss and make love. I don't think we ever watched a movie all the way through. We were the couple that people envied. When we walked into a restaurant, we drew smiles and nods from both the waiters and the customers. They wanted to be us. We were so much in love. We couldn't help but glow, and people noticed. Now, they can't help noticing the circles under my eyes and my loss of weight. They worry about my health and wonder if I should be seeing a doctor. Maybe so, but what I have can't be solved with a pill. I am miserable and only you are the cure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Do I still love you? Of course. Since you left I have groped for meaning in life. You were my life. Your leaving was like an amputation--without anesthesia. I know I have only myself to blame. I let stresses dictate my words and actions. I brought home my work and my frustrations. I became angry and lashed out at the one person who had nothing to do with the problem. I stopped expressing my love for you--my problems became the soul issue of conversation. Over time, that cancer ate away at our happiness until our relationship was sick and dying. I understand why you had to leave. I know that you needed distance and to become healthy again. And this has shocked reality into me. I recognize that I have lost (or could lose) that which is most precious to me--you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>But I believe with all my heart that our relationship could still work, if you would be willing to give me another chance. My deep love for you is the motivating force in making what I know will be difficult but necessary changes. I believe in our love. I don't ever want to put it on the line again. I am willing to work harder than I have ever worked at anything in my life to regain the love that we once had. I have learned, and I hope I am better for the pain. What I don't know is how you feel? Do you miss me too? Is there any love left to give it another try?<br><br><br><br><br><br>What I am asking is if you would be willing to se me again. I'm not asking you for a commitment or to come with huge expectations. I'm just asking you to come to dinner with me. Maybe we could talk and see if there is still any magic left. With the hope that you'll say yes, I've made reservations for two at Marie's Restaurant for this Saturday night. We've had so many happy memories there. I think you'll see a humble soul who desperately wants to change and hold onto your love. Would you agree to dinner?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'll call you Thursday afternoon to see if you're willing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember the best of our relationship.|I miss you. When we first separated, I thought that being apart from you was what I wanted. I thought that we would both be happier on our own and living separate lives, but I was wrong. I think about you all the time. I remember the wonderful times that we shared. It's more than just reminiscing about happy memories in the past; it's a yearning to create more of them in the future.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know that I can admit when I'm wrong. I know that the separation was my idea, but I'm admitting to you now that it was a mistake. I love you. I've never stopped loving you; I just let other things get in the way. I have been so miserable since I asked you to leave. I miss everything about being with you. I even miss the small things--the way you would touch my face as you walked by, the way you loved to get up and make Sunday breakfast and the sound of your laughter. I need you back in my life. I hope you need me to.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've learned a lot during the last few months. I've learned that I can't take happiness for granted. I've learned that I need to focus on what's really important and not let little things cloud the big picture. I believe that we can start over and be happy again. I really want to work at being happy again, and I only want to do it with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope that you feel the same way. I hope that you miss me as much as I miss you. I'd like to see you. Let's talk about our future and, I believe we have one. I'll make reservations at that little Italian place on Maple Street that we always went to when we wanted to have a quiet dinner and talk. I'll call you tomorrow to see what time would work best for you. I can't wait to see you again.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
777|Love||Dear Ex: Things turned out okay for everyone. (We're older now, but wiser.)|Remember how you used to brag to your friends that your wife was so smart? Well, I've been accepted to a college out West and will be moving soon. Perhaps Jenny already told you--I know the two of you still keep in touch. As you know, getting married right out of high school put a stop to my college plans and caused me some regret. I had always wanted to go back to school and, now that the kids have moved out, I've finally grabbed the opportunity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was thinking about our marriage the other day. Actually, the thirteen years of my life that I spent with you come to mind fairly frequently as I continue to try to make sense of it all. It hit me with some force recently that our relationship, even though it failed in the usual sense, was truly successful in another important respect because it accomplished an essential purpose of marriage--it brought healthy children into the world. Everything else--the pain, the tears, the trauma--are all short-lived and fairly unimportant in the grand scheme of things. What matters most is that three children grew up reasonably healthy, found stable husbands and, in their own individual ways, have helped to make the world go >round.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think you know that Lisa was an airline attendant for a while, Jenny started her own little art business from home, and Anna is a mail carrier with the post office. In the past few years, as you know, all of them have also brought healthy children into the world. I don't know how the reality of having four grandchildren has affected you, but I'm feeling very matriarchal right now. And those children and grandchildren wouldn't have been possible without our relationship, stormy though it was. The point is, even though our divorce was final many years ago, the successful results of our marriage remain and go on quite nicely without us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Once in a while, Jenny lets me know how things are going on your end. She told me that you're taking a computer course at the shop. Sounds like a good idea--maybe it will help you get off that backbreaking piecework. Most decent jobs seem to require a certain amount of computer savvy nowadays. I'll be using a computer myself to write all those college term papers. I'm glad that both of us are still working on increasing our individual potential.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Jenny also told me that you still have your country-western band and play on the weekends as you always did. I remember it was a great outlet for you after a hard week at the shop and it would be a waste not to share your talents and charisma with the world. I have many good memories of going out with you when your band played on Saturday nights. In fact, one of the greatest pleasures of my life was dancing on a slick wooden floor while you sang and played in some smoky tavern.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The beginning of the end came after Anna was born and it was difficult for me to still go out every Saturday night and support you. I realize now what a powerful distraction the inevitable band groupies must have been, especially as the years went by. At any rate, I think if we got together again we would discover that we had outgrown each other--an inevitable risk of getting married when we were both so young and immature. Nevertheless, you were the great love of my life and the father of my children. I hope you still have some regard for me as your first love and the only mother of your children. I also hope you found whatever elusive happiness you were looking for when you left us. Perhaps some Saturday night you could dedicate a song to your ex-wife--for auld lang syne.|I hope this letter finds you well. I can't believe that it's been almost a year since we last talked. Time flies, doesn't it? How are things going for you? I know you talked about changing majors before--did you switch to business administration, or did you decide to stick with child psychology? I'm sure whatever you decided to do, you're doing just great. You were always such a good student, and it's one of the things that I admired most about you. If I'd been as dedicated as you when I started college, instead of chasing after a certain brunette, I wouldn't have had to take some of those blasted G.E. classes over again. But it was worth it. We had some good times, didn't we? Like the time that we started a riot in the student union because they wouldn't let us roller blade around campus.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyway, things are going pretty well for me these days. You may remember that I was planning to apply for law school last fall. I was accepted to Washburn University back in February, and I'll be moving to Kansas in September. I'm really looking forward to continuing my education. I guess you'll be applying for grad schools soon, too, huh? Taking a year off has been really good for me (no homework and a lot less stress), but I have to admit that I've missed the challenge that comes with doing papers and projects. I never thought I'd say that. I bet you didn't think I would, either!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm sorry that things ended up the way they did. In retrospect, we made some pretty big mistakes, didn't we? But I think that you would agree that things are better this way. I wish I hadn't caused you the pain that I did, but I'm glad that we've both been able to move on and start rebuilding our lives. When we were freshmen everything seemed so simple, and after we fell in love so quickly, getting married after only a couple of months of dating felt natural. Obviously, we both had a lot of growing up to do still; we didn't even know who we were, let alone who we wanted to be. Though it was a rocky road, things turned out for the best in the end, didn't they? We learned a lot about ourselves, and I think we're both stronger and wiser people now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish you success in all that you do. Good luck as you continue your studies. I know that you can accomplish all of your dreams. You certainly deserve to.|When we were married, you always urged me to try my hand at business. Of course, I deferred because our children were small at the time and I couldn't think how I would juggle mothering and a career. But we grow older, don't we? I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I've taken the plunge (maybe Paula or Matt already told you). I applied for a small business loan and I'm starting my own mail order scrap-booking company. You remember those funny creations I used to make in the evenings? Well, some people began to ask for them and I actually believe that they might be marketable. I wanted to thank you for the encouragement you gave me years ago.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I sometimes wonder how life is treating you. I only receive scanty updates from the children, so I hope all is well. Every so often I think about our marriage--fondly now. I know it was hard for both of us at the time. Emotions ran high; things were said we both regretted. No one likes the feeling of failure. But time heals, as they say. I remember a lot of good times and two incredible kids who are the product of both of us. There's no failure in that. I look into there eyes and see bits of both of us. They are good, productive human beings. I see your good qualities in them, and that helps me to remember how much I admired you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now that Paula and Matt are on their own, I feel older and a little wiser. I know we were both young when we married--probably a little immature and very nave. Life threw us some curves that we weren't expecting so I don't really know if things could have turned out differently. At this point in my life, I remember you with respect and fondness. I'm happy for your successes and hope that life brings you much happiness. I hope that you will remember me fondly as your first love and as the mother of your children. As the years go by, I hope we will both continue to take pride in our greatest success--our children.|"Just felt like dropping you a line. I've been really busy lately--how about you? In March I took a trip to England to meet with some investors. Now I understand how you felt about driving on the right side! I can't say I loved it, and I was glad to get back home. I took a community cooking class last fall, and I've actually become a pretty decent chef. Now dinner isn't limited to macaroni and cheese or microwaveable pizza. I feel that I'm settling into life and, for the most part, I am content. I hope life is going well for you, likewise. Could you drop me a line and let me know?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our little daughter, Karen, is not so little any more. As you know, she has come to visit me a couple of times. I am so proud of her. She's going to make a great doctor--she'll ""change the world for the better"" just like she always said she would. She is a beautiful result of our life together and I am grateful for any time I get to spend with her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm happy to hear that you're going back to school. I admire your decision, and I hope you are enjoying yourself. When we were college students, we had some good times, didn't we? Remember when we fell asleep studying in the Hall of Flags after hours and got thrown out by the janitor? You didn't let it frazzle you, though, and you managed to ace the test the next morning. I'm sure you're still the top-notch student today you were then.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For all of our good times together, I realize how much happier we've been since we decided to go our separate ways. I've noticed how my stress level has gone down, and I hope yours has, too. We both seem to be enjoying life more now and successfully finding ourselves in ways we never could before.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know that I only try to remember the good times. I have no ill feelings, and I don't bear any grudges. We'll always be Karen's parents, and I hope we can keep in touch from time to time. I wish you all the happiness the future has to offer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Good luck with school and all your new endeavors."|I was looking into our son's eyes the other day and I thought of you. He has your blue eyes. It seems that every day he looks a little bit more like you. He brings great joy into my life, and I know that you feel the same way. Although our relationship didn't work out the way we thought it would, I have never regretted it because of him. Without our relationship, he wouldn't be a part of my life or yours. I can't bear that thought.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know I'm doing well. As you know, I've remarried and now have a little girl. We are very happy together and I am content with the way my life is turning out. It doesn't have all of the excitement that we had together, but it is steadier and more secure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I do occasionally relive some of our times together. We sure had some crazy times. Do you remember the time that, on the spur of the moment, we jumped in the car and drove to the Jersey shore? We bought hot dogs from a street vendor, slept on the beach, and came home the next day a little sunburned. We sure had a lot of fun!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope that you are doing well. I bear no grudges against you and wish only good things for you. I think we're both happier apart than we would have been together, but you are an important part of my past. I will always love you for giving me our son and a lot of good memories.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||
778|Love||Goodbye forever (It's time to go our separate ways.)|I never thought I would be writing you this letter. There was a time when I thought our love would stand the test of time and nothing could come between us. Unfortunately, the years have chipped away at our once perfect relationship and there is nothing left to hold on to. The way things are now, we are no longer a positive influence in each other's life. We just make each other miserable instead of happy, and make life harder rather than easier. It is time to call it quits and go our separate ways.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know that I am not blaming you. I think we have both done everything we could and pursued every option available to try to keep this relationship together, but nothing has helped. We've had trial separations, gone to a marriage counselor for months, read self-help books and ordered Dr. Phil's tapes. It should be clear to both of us by now that we are fighting a losing battle. The simplest problem or disagreement always gets blown up out of proportion and meaningful communication is no longer possible. The tension in our apartment is so thick you could cut it with a knife.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How many times have we said we have had enough and never wanted to see each other again, only to kiss and make up, then try again? Well, someone has to be the one to say enough is enough and I am doing it now. This time I am not coming back. I have moved in with an old friend until I can make other arrangements. When you come home and find this letter you will also see that I have packed my things and my drawers are empty. Inevitably, there will be things that mean so much to both of us that we will have to sit down together and decide who gets what. If we cannot do that amicably, then we will have to get lawyers to sort it out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I believe that parting now is the best thing for both us. We still have our careers we can concentrate on and we both have friendly relationships with the children. Even though they are adults now, I know they will find this news painful, but it was also painful for them to come to visit and find us squabbling. No solution will please everyone or solve all our problems. We still have happy memories from the past; we need to concentrate on making the present as happy as possible and try to keep a positive outlook on the future. I think a year from now we will both be doing so much better that we'll probably wonder why we hadn't ended the relationship sooner.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know I wish you all the best. You have a lot of great qualities that will serve you well in the future. Let's try to remember the good times, let go of our present miseries, and have the common sense to move on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Goodbye and farewell.|"I know that I was the one that suggested that we try yet again to work things out and start over, but I've finally realized something: we're just not right for each other; we're just not compatible. I think that last night proved that. Not that I'm blaming you for what happened. I suppose that we just never were really meant to be together. So this time, instead of chasing after a happiness that we're just not going to find together, let's end things now, before things get worse again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We've tried to work things out so many times over the last year but nothing ever changes. Again, it's no one's fault. We are the way we are: headstrong, passionate, stubborn--was it your dad who called it ""bullheaded""? Anyway, these similarities that give us our independent spirits and initially drew us together seem to be the very characteristics that always drive a wedge between us. The beautiful makeup episodes that always follow don't make it any better. We still come back to the same thing: neither one of us can bend on the issues that are really important to us, and there are just too many crucial things that we can't see eye to eye on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So I'm done this time, Jake. By the time you get this letter, I'll already be gone. Please don't try to contact me. I've made up my mind, and even your sweet talk, persuasive as it is, won't make me change my mind this time. I'm getting off this roller coaster ride once and for all.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm truly sorry for the pain that this breakup will cause you. It's not going to be easy for me either, believe me. I really wish things didn't have to be this way, but you'll see, by and by, that I'm right in ending our relationship. It just won't work. Someday, I know, you'll agree that it was the best thing for both of us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Whatever happens, I wish you well. You truly do deserve the best that life has to offer you. Please know that I do love you, and a part of me always will."|This is a letter that I never thought I would have to write. To say that I've agonized over it is an understatement. I come to it now without having had much sleep for a few days, but with a clear realization of what I must say and do.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let me start by saying what I think we both feel, but what we've both been unable to say out loud: our relationship is not working, and it hasn't worked for a long time. In fact, rather than strengthening our lives, it just weighs us down and makes our lives more difficult. We've tried calm discussions, silence, arguing--we even tried a counselor. How many times have we decided to 'kiss and make up' only to find ourselves battling the same demons once again?<br><br><br><br><br><br>A few days ago, I started to make a two-column list: your issues and mine. Then I realized that it was a waste of time. I came to the conclusion that no one is at fault. We are simply two different personalities who have tried to make a relationship work and just couldn't do it. This brings me to one of the hardest decisions of my life--I've got to move on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you will honor my decision and not ask me to reconsider, as I have not arrived at it casually. I do not want either one of us to go through this painful process twice because I truly believe that this is the best resolution for both of us. We still have an opportunity to part quietly and with dignity, and I think we should take it now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish you well and I hope you will believe that this is not just a trite phrase. I have always wanted you to be happy, so please believe me now when I say that I wish you a wonderful and fulfilling life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Goodbye my dear friend.|This letter is probably long overdue, but I put it off because I loved you, I wanted things to work out, and I didn't want to hurt you. But the time has come. Our relationship just isn't working anymore. It is causing more pain than joy for both of us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There's no point going over our problems; we both know what they are. And we also both know everything we've done to try to work them out. And we have tried, haven't we? We had some really great talks about what needed to change, but nothing did. We even sought professional help but, apparently, we were past that point already.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've thought about this a lot and I know in my heart that we will both be happier with other people. I will not be coming back. We both need to move on with our lives and find relationships better suited to our individual needs.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We loved each other well--for a time. A small part of my heart will always remember that love and remember the happy times we had together, for there were many.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I truly wish you the best of luck and happiness in your life--with your job, with your family, and with finding a new love.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
779|Love||Happy Anniversary! (Thanks for always being there!)|"I don't think I express my appreciation to you often enough for having given me so many happy years, so I've decided to write this letter--an anniversary card just doesn't say enough. This way I can sit down and gather my thoughts together and present them to you with a small token of my love. I know you've always enjoyed Gilbert & Sullivan musical comedies, so I've purchased tickets for us to see ""The Pirates of Penzance"" on Saturday evening. I believe that's one we saw when we started dating so many years ago. We were always going to musicals and plays back then. I remember that ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was your favorite Shakespearean comedy. After we were married, though, our children started arriving quickly and our theater-going days diminished rapidly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't think that either one of us minded too much, though, because our kids always seemed to provide enough entertainment of their own. How I admired your parenting skills through the years! I still don't know how you did everything so well, even from the beginning--our little ones certainly didn't come with a manual. I will always be grateful for the help you gave me, too, when I started to get a little heavy-handed with them. I benefited from your guidance and motherly skills almost as much as the children did. Now that they have all left the nest, we can be glad that none of them have any complaints about their childhood years--at least not yet! For the moment, anyway, we can wipe our brows in relief and turn our attention back to each other and our well-earned, newly regained freedom.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to assure you that the passing years have not diminished my love for you in the least. Instead, my love has only deepened with time because it always gives me more opportunities to appreciate how you successfully manage every new challenge that confronts us. Please don't ever concern yourself with a gray hair here or a wrinkle there, my Dear. Although you are as beautiful to me as ever, I also admire your inner beauty, which merely intensifies with the passing years.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I finally understand the meaning of all those songs that talk about endless love. I don't think they are just hyperbole or poetic expressions, after all. I believe now that a love that has endured this earthly test can never end. I swore to love you for time and all eternity and I will happily do that, my Love. I am so grateful that you continue to love me, too--despite my failures and shortcomings. Thank you for always being there and helping me to be all that I can be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Happy Anniversary!"|As I was standing in the greeting card section of the grocery store a couple of days ago, I just couldn't find a card that could adequately express the love that I feel for you. After a year of marriage, I just can't believe how happy I have been. You make me feel like I can do anything--and with you by my side, I know that I can. They say that the first year of matrimony is the hardest and, if that's so, we really have an easy life ahead of us! Of course, things can't always be perfect, but they've been very, very good, and I'm so grateful to you for that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for being so good to me and for being so loving, patient, and kind. You're as thoughtful today as you were on our first date. Do you remember how nervous we were around each other back then? Things got better as we got to know each other more. I'm thankful that you're so willing to listen to me and to share with me your feelings and dreams, even your concerns and your worries. I always heard how important open communication was in marriage, and now I wholeheartedly believe it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I honestly can't think of how my life would be without you in it other than barren, bleak, cold, and meaningless. I know that as the years pass, the love that we share will continue to grow. I look forward to those years when we'll be raising our kids together, building a home, and fulfilling our dreams. Crazy as it may sound, I even look forward to growing old together. I once heard that men are like fine wine--they only improve with age. The thought of all the upcoming years spent by your side brings me a joy and a peace that I can hardly comprehend. I know that, no matter what, we'll stay together, through thick and thin. That's what real love and commitment is all about, and that's what I have for you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Honey, I know how blessed I am, and I want you to know that I know it. So, instead of a card, I'm giving you the enclosed gift certificate for a weekend getaway at the Alaskan Getaway Inn. Just follow the map on the back. I think you'll forgive me for giving it to you a couple of days early. I'll be waiting in cabin 12. Don't be too long.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Yours always and forever!|I was remembering our courtship and how we would look into each other's eyes and talk about growing old together. Of course, we had no idea what that meant, but we knew we had our whole lives before us. Now, here we are, (not old yet!) twenty years later, still in love, still happy, still looking toward the horizon, wanting to walk the journey of life together. Do I say it often enough?--I love you! Thank you for loving me back and being my beautiful and wonderful companion for the last twenty years. That's 240 months, or 7,300 days, or 175,200 hours, or 10,512,000 minutes--every moment a treasure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What can I give you to express my love? What gift could I possibly give you that would sum up the years of love that you've given me? A sapphire ring--that is what I have decided on. I know that gem has always been your favorite. It is precious like our love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And we've had fun, haven't we? Remember when the kids were young and we were so broke that we could only take a vacation in a tent? Mostly, we just fought off mosquitoes, you tried to make pancakes over a fire, and I got us all lost on a trail. I laugh every time I think about it. And remember our first trip to Disneyland? We had saved for an entire year. The car broke down in Las Vegas (I think it was 120 degrees outside). We tried to stay cool by toweling off with water and drinking sodas, but three hundred and fifty bucks later and we were on our way again. It ended up being my favorite vacation. We shared so much--both good times and hard times--but we've faced everything together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I started listing the reasons I love you, but it was becoming a tome. Let me just say that I never worry about your reaction to adversity. When I fall apart, you stand firm like a rock. You have always been faithful to me (how many people can say that today?). I've heard that it is better to be trusted than to be loved. I trust you--you have always been loyal to me. I love you for your smile and sense of humor. At the end of a hard day, I have always looked forward to seeing your happy face. Even your eyes seem to smile--those happy creases at the corners. I love you for your love of books and for instilling into our children an appreciation of good literature. I think you can discuss any subject with intelligence. I love you for putting our marriage and our family first. It seems that you regard no sacrifice as too much. Thank you for loving me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The years have made you beautiful. I know that we both have been chagrined when we discovered a new gray hair or wrinkle. But to me you will always seem young, vibrant, and desirable beyond expression. Twenty years ago, I had no idea that I would marry a woman that would become more and more lovely as time passed. And that is the way of our love: it grows more beautiful with each passing day. We have been through so much together, I know we can weather the years ahead. We are one; we are united with a bond that can never be broken.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that the great poets have struggled to pen words that adequately describe this kind of love. In the end they discover they fall woefully short. And so do I. Please accept this poor attempt as my expression of undying love and devotion. Thank you for being all that you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Happy Anniversary, Sweetheart! I love you!|You are the love of my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our marriage has always been my greatest source of peace and happiness. Spending time with you is all that I want, because that's when I feel the most contented. I love you, and I want to thank you for the many wonderful years we've spent together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope these flowers will bring a smile to your face and make our special day even brighter for you. I remember the first time I brought you flowers. We hadn't known each other very long, and I wasn't sure how you'd react to receiving a gift from me. You don't know how happy I felt when you threw your arms around me and gave me a hug!<br><br><br><br><br><br>You've always been open and honest about your feelings--that is something I've always cherished about you. There's something else I love about you. When life has overwhelmed me, your reassuring voice and words of wisdom have helped to get me through. You know how to encourage me, raise my spirits, and never fail to make me feel good.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Remember when we had been dating only a short while and I invited you to one of my basketball games?--the game I lost single-handedly? I was trying so hard to impress you that I took my eyes off the ball and ended up knocking over the other team's water table. The game didn't improve as I injured fans with my wild passes and shot a record twelve air balls. I was sure that our relationship was doomed, but every time I looked over at you, you were smiling that big beautiful smile of yours and cheering me on. Our marriage has been full of similar, uplifting experiences. No matter what whirlwinds surround me, I can always count on your support. You've always been an example of selfless love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With each passing year, our love has grown, and you just become more beautiful to me. On our wedding day, I promised to love you forever. That promise is sacred to me--the easiest promise I've ever had or wanted to keep. I reaffirm my promise to always love you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Happy anniversary, Sweetheart. Thank you for always being there!|"Happy Anniversary, my Love! I can remember standing at the altar with you ten years ago, staring into your blue eyes, and thinking that I could never love anyone as much as you. That feeling has only deepened with time. When I gaze into your eyes now, I realize that my love for you is boundless; it has increased exponentially on a daily basis since we said our vows. We have truly been blessed to have found each other.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I reflect on our lives together, my mind is flooded with happy memories of times we've spent together. Although I realize there have been some tough times, those have only served to make our relationship stronger, and I'm so thankful for that--that we didn't let those difficult times tear us apart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The last ten years have been wonderful! Do you remember skinny-dipping on the roof of that hotel in Hawaii on our honeymoon? Or learning to scuba dive on that cruise to the Caribbean? We have seen some amazing places together. I hope that we continue to travel together and see the world. Do you remember when our daughter was born? I thought my heart would burst with love as I watched you hold her for the first time, tears of joy in your eyes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Time passes. Your strawberry blonde hair is flecked with gray, but so is mine, and you are as beautiful to me as you ever were. I love you for more than your curly hair and blue eyes. I love you for your generosity to others, for your empathy to those around you. I love you for the way you always encourage me to follow my dreams and try new things. I love you for the love that you show me on a daily basis, both in word and in deed. I love you for being the woman that you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Even if I could, I wouldn't change a thing. I know without a doubt that our love for each other will continue to grow through the years, and we will be laughing and reminiscing 50 years from now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But to celebrate our tenth anniversary now, I have a surprise for you. You know how we love to travel and how we go to a Broadway show every year. This year, I thought I'd combine both and take us to New York City for a long weekend. I've bought tickets to your favorite musical--""The Phantom of the Opera."" I can't wait to get away with you and start making happy memories for the next ten years!"|||||||||||||||||||||||||||
780|Love||Has someone come between us? (I see the telltale signs.)|"I was driving home today and listening to the oldies channel on the radio when I heard the Righteous Brothers singing, ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling."" It just made me think of us, especially when they sang, ""something beautiful is dying."" I remembered how we were when we first got married and how you couldn't wait to get home to see me and nothing was important enough to keep us apart. We were so happy then, and life was so good that I thought it would last forever. Lately, though, I'm worried that something is happening to us and you really are losing that loving feeling.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now it seems you stay at work later and later and have started going out of town on unscheduled business trips without me. I can't remember the last time we went out to dinner together or to a movie, or even spent an entire evening at home relaxing. We used to share our deepest secrets with each other, but now we hardly even talk anymore. When we first got married, nothing I ever did seemed to annoy you, but lately, as in the song, you ""criticize little things I do"" more and more often. I'm beginning to worry that something beautiful really is dying and wonder if it's because another woman has come between us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know I still love you. You're the only man I've ever loved and my stomach turns over when I think about you leaving. Do you still love me or have you found someone else? I need to know where I stand and I don't want to imagine things that aren't true. The strain of worrying is already starting to take its toll, so please be honest with me. I need to know what is on your mind and what you are planning to do. There's no point in trying to save this relationship if you've already found someone else and there's nothing left to save.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If you're not seeing anyone else and we have other problems, maybe we should think about going to a marriage counselor. A third party might help us get everything out in the open. Counselors try to remain neutral because they know that's the only way to help people to reach an understanding. It might be worth a try if you still love me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As it is, I don't want to continue the way we are any longer. Without total commitment to each other, we really don't have a relationship worth saving, and we would be better off separated. There's an old saying that two's company and three's a crowd, so please let me know if I'm the one who's crowding you. If not, I'm willing to work at improving our relationship, but only if you are, too. You need to decide--soon. I'm waiting for your answer."|"You know, when we first started seeing each other and then started dating seriously, I felt that I was the happiest man in the world. We were in graduate school then, and even though we were both so busy, we always made time for each other, even if it was only a quick bite at the student union or a hasty e-mail written around study schedules. Now we are settled in our careers and yet we are spending less time together than we ever have.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I thought when we moved in together that we were really committed to this relationship, but now I feel like we're living worlds apart. You're never at home anymore--you always say that you're ""Going out"" with this girlfriend, or with that group of friends, but lately I'm beginning to wonder. You come home late almost every night, and I wonder what you are doing. Are there that so many movies to see, restaurants to try, and clubs where you mingle? What's more, when I try to talk to you just to see how things are going, you seem to brush my questions, and me, aside. We never do anything together anymore, not like we used to. No more star-gazing sessions, trips to antique stores, or evenings spent at home cooking and eating together. What happened to those days?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you. You're the bright spot in my life. But I need to know what's going on. If I've done something to upset you or hurt you, please tell me so that I can fix it or--and I hate to suggest this--if there's someone else, I need to know that, as well. I need to know the truth, and I need to know where we stand. I'm willing to work through any challenges we may have, if you are, but if there's no hope of having a meaningful relationship, if someone else has stolen the place I once held in your heart, then we might as well end this farce now. I can't go on this way any longer."|"I should never listen to the radio. Today I was listening to the Beatles singing, ""Ticket to Ride."" I got all choked up (you know how I get emotional over silly things). They were singing about a guy that was losing his girl, but it could have been the other way around: ""He said that living with me was bringing her down. She would never be free while I was around."" Well, I got teary-eyed. When I pulled up to a stoplight, a woman looked at me and seemed concerned.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When we first started dating, we couldn't be apart from each other for a single day. Then we married and the courtship continued. You would call me at lunch and during breaks. Flowers and love notes showed up unexpectedly. Early in our marriage, we discovered that we had a passion for baseball, and we spent evenings watching ESPN, eating popcorn and cussing the umpires. And we had other passions, too. Where did all that go? I used to tell my friends and family that I had never been happier. I think you were, too. What happened?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Are you becoming bored with me? Or worse, is there someone else? (I'm sorry, but I need to ask.) Please believe me when I say that I love you. I think you know that--I tell you often enough. But how do you feel? I really need to know. We have often said that honesty is the basis of a lasting relationship. Would you be honest with me now? I feel that something negative has crept into our relationship; something has changed. I can sense it. You seem preoccupied with work. No more daytime calls. No more flowers. We have stopped having our weekend dates. We haven't watched a ballgame in over a year. If I'm lucky, I get a quick kiss on the cheek before we say good night. When we talk, you seem to pick at me--and I feel belittled and small. Do you still love me?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have hesitated bringing this up, but maybe we should seek some advice from a third party. A marriage counselor might help us get everything out in the open. The way we are going is not healthy. It can only go in one direction. If we have a love between us that is worth preserving, I believe it is worth the effort. If the worst is happening and you have given your heart to someone else, I feel that I deserve the courtesy of knowing--now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm sorry if I'm jumping to a conclusion, but the deterioration of our relationship has been so dramatic lately that I don't know what to think. Please let me know and, if you're willing, please come with me to a counselor. Please decide--soon. I need your answer."|Do you remember how it was between us in the beginning? We laughed all the time; we were spontaneous. It wasn't unusual for us to jump in the car and drive somewhere for the weekend. We just wanted to explore someplace new, and we enjoyed every minute of it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We would hold hands anytime we were walking side by side. If you passed me in the house, you would touch my cheek or kiss my forehead. There was always a kiss hello and a kiss goodbye. You told me you loved me at least twice a day and every time you said it, I could feel that you meant it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Lately, though, things have been changing. I need you to tell me the truth. Is there someone else? All the classic signs are there. You're working late almost every night and on weekends--or at least you say you are. There have been several occasions when I answered the phone only to get a dial tone. We never seem to touch anymore or go anywhere together. Our home has been devoid of laughter for a while now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At first I thought that I was just imagining things. I tried to talk myself into believing that you were just busy at work and that some local kids were making prank calls to us. But I know now that's not it, and I can't pretend anymore that it is.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the past, we've always been able to talk to each other and we've always been able to trust each other. Honesty has been an important cornerstone of our marriage, so if there is someone else, please be honest with me. Tell me now. I need to know what's going on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I need to know if you think this marriage is worth saving. I'm willing to give it another try if you are. I'm willing to see a marriage counselor to find out if there is any hope that our marriage can continue, but I need to know if there's someone else. I need to know that you're totally committed to us and that you love me and want to make this work. If you don't feel that way, it doesn't make any sense to continue the way we are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you. I want to know if you love me the way you used to. If you don't, please let me know now.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
781|Love||I love you. (Last night was unforgettable!)|"I sit here, lost in the memory of you. What is today? I don't know. What is it I'm supposed to be doing now? I can't remember. It couldn't have been very important. Thoughts of last night still fill my mind and heart. Nothing else seems worth my time and effort. Where am I? Well, not here in this confined space, not really. I'm still lost in everything I felt when we were together. That was when you and I became ""us"" and I could no longer tell where you left off and I began. I love you, Lisa, and my love is lasting and true. I'm not sure when it began but I know it will never end. Surely, life can offer no higher fulfillment than what we experienced last night.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There can be no other woman in my life now but you. I've been involved in other relationships in the past, but they certainly can't compare to what I have found with you or to what I'm feeling now. Perhaps the others were just ""dry runs,"" practice for the real thing, for a reality that I couldn't even imagine until I had experienced it for myself. Last night, I couldn't help but surrender to the feelings that had captured my soul and yet promised me freedom and joy. Today, the words of an old John Denver song come to mind, and it is only now that I understand what the ""sweet surrender"" he sang about really means.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You must know I can't stand being away from you much longer. I hope you feel the same way. Lisa, tell me when can I see you again!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you."|I hope you know how much our relationship has come to mean to me. Getting to know you over these last few months has changed my life. I'm happier than I have ever been, and I owe that joy to you. Before I met you, there was an emptiness in my heart that at times seemed to consume me, that threatened to break me--but now my life is full of meaning and purpose. I can see my future more clearly now--you are the light in the dark that guides my steps to where I want to be. When the entire world was once overcast by subtle shades of gray, when I seemed caught in a perpetual winter, you brought vibrant color to my life, and in my heart I felt the renewal, the warmth and sunlight of spring again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I adore your kind smile and your gentle eyes. You have so much good in you--you treat me so well. I love your quiet strength, and your desire to do right. You have such a love for others, and your example makes me want to be the best that I can be. You can always make me laugh, even when I don't always want to. When I look into your eyes--those gorgeous azure eyes--I see a reflection of my own soul. And in your arms, I know there is no place on earth that I would rather be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In quiet moments, I wonder what I ever did to be blessed to have you in my life. You remind me of what is truly important in this life, and I'll always be grateful to Fate for bringing us together. I can't remember what my life was about before you became a part of it. You're always on my mind--in my thoughts, and in my dreams.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you so much and I hope you know that I will always be here for you. I am yours now and forever, body and soul. Like the ebb and flow of the ocean waves, my love for you goes on forever and forever; like the great redwoods that reach toward the sky, my love for you grows and grows--higher, stronger, deeper. I can't imagine my life without you anymore. I've never loved anyone as I have loved you--I know now I never will. You're everything to me.|"Is the world still spinning? Since last night when you and I ceased to be individuals but became ""us,"" I have felt that I was residing on a world where time did not exist. Is it night or day? I don't know anymore. I no longer need food; sleep is impossible. I have no interest in world events or market prices. All that matters is you. If the sun rises, it rises because of you. If the moon courses across the sky and bathes the world in yellow light, it does so because you exist.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Is this the love they write about in romance novels? What else could it be? What else could compare to this feeling? Surely life would have no meaning for me without you. And other girls? A vague memory. They were only schoolboy romances, puppy love, meaningless flirtations. I can honestly say that nothing I thought I felt could ever compare with the profound love I feel for you now. I am finally alive! What does the poet say?<br><br><br><br><br><br>There were bells on the hills<br><br><br><br><br><br>But I never heard them ringing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>No, I never heard them at all,<br><br><br><br><br><br>Till there was you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I must see you again. This afternoon is not soon enough. Tonight is too late. Now I know there could be no other woman in my life but you. Please tell me when I can see you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you."|You have been constantly on my mind since our last date. I'm more convinced than ever of my feelings for you. I love you, Jane. I only want you in my life, and no longer want to see anyone else.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've never felt like I do now. I can't compare the depth of my emotions to anything I've ever experienced before. I feel like I'm finally breathing fresh air!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't wait to see you again! The weekend seems so far away!|"I don't know how I made it home last night. Did I drive, walk, fly? I hazily recall walking through my front door and collapsing on my bed. Then I spent many sweet and sleepless hours vividly thinking of you--each detail of your face, your voice, your touch.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You swept me off my feet (literally!) and my heart has never beaten so fast. I cannot find the words to describe my feelings. How can I express the ways you're changing my life? Simply saying, ""I love you"" seems so inadequate. My affection is so much greater than those three little words. Forgive me for not being more eloquent; just try to sense in those deceptively simple words the profound depth of feeling within me. I love you, Jane. I cannot say it any better.<br><br><br><br><br><br>No one in my life compares with you. No one ever could. I don't need to search further; there is no one else I'd rather spend my life with. All my past relationships pale in comparison to my life with you in vivid, vibrant colors. This morning, I heard Nat King Cole on the radio singing, ""The Very Thought of You."" He was singing just what I want to say to you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The mere idea of you, the longing here for you...<br><br><br><br><br><br>You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you...<br><br><br><br><br><br>When can I see you again? I want to do something special for you. Name the day, and I'll plan a night for us both to remember."|"Like the song says, last night was ""Just Like Heaven."" I'm sitting here at work, thinking of you, and I can't even find the words that will express the way I'm feeling. I can tell you this, though--after last night, I am 100% positive that I'm in love with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love everything about you... I love your blue eyes, your thick hair, and your smile. I love the sound of your laugh and of your voice, and the warmth of your body when you hold me. I love the smell of your cologne and the taste of your lips. I love how, when you touch me, tingles race up and down my spine. You arouse all of my senses.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't want to be with anyone else; I only want to be with you. I've never felt this way about anyone before. I feel like I'm floating, like my heart is skipping, like my mouth will never stop smiling. I love talking to you; I feel like I could tell you anything. I love the way that you respect my opinions, even when they differ from your own. I love the way that I feel special whenever you're around. It feels like there's no one else in the room. I love how you look into my eyes and I feel like I can see into the depths of your soul.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love the man that you are, and I cannot wait to see you again."||||||||||||||||||||||||||
782|Love||I really miss you. (Please come home soon.)|"I woke up this morning confused and disoriented. It took a minute or two to clear my head and remember where you were and why you weren't in bed with me. When I did, my anxiety subsided and I just felt that lonely feeling that is starting to become familiar now. You've been gone for more than two weeks now--not very long in the grand scheme of things, I suppose, but the longest we've been separated in over three years. The house is empty without you and sometimes I begin to talk to myself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm lucky I still have a job to go to--even though it's only part-time, it takes up a good part of the day. That's actually my social life now--going to work and going shopping. What in the world did I do before I married you? Well, I did have a circle of single friends then, but they're all married now, too, or have moved away. Consequently, I don't have enough to distract me and I'm left to my own devices.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have no desire to cook for myself, so I'm eating a lot of take-out and a delivery pizza once in a while. With only one person eating pizza, though, it takes three days to finish it off! I've also started going for long walks in the evening, listening to heart-breaking love songs on my homemade CDs. I rent a lot of movies from Blockbuster, too, and that helps pass the time, as well. I've learned to avoid the tear-jerkers and usually stick to romantic comedies that have a happy ending. The day you left, I marked the day on the calendar when you would be coming home and providing us with our own happy ending.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It will only take me about 45 minutes to get to the airport to pick you up, so I'll call the airline an hour before your scheduled arrival on Thursday to make sure your flight is running on time. The weather is a little unpredictable this time of year, so you never know about scattered showers. I thought we could grab a bite afterwards at Sizzler and then spend the evening at home relaxing and catching up on the past few weeks. Although I don't have a lot to tell you, I want to hear all about your trip and how the business end of it went, too (I know your promotion is dependent on that!).<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm sure you'll be exhausted! How many hours of time difference are you dealing with where you're at--three or four? I'm sure it will take a couple of days to get back in the swing of things here. Luckily, you'll have the weekend to adjust your sleeping schedule before you need to go back to work again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There are so many things I want to do when you get back. First of all, there's that new documentary at the mall cinema that's causing so much stir on the Entertainment Report on CNN. Also, I told you I haven't been doing much cooking, so I definitely want to prepare your favorite spaghetti and meatballs dinner with toasted garlic bread on Friday evening. Rick and Pamela want to get together with us next week, too, and have a game night at their house next week--we bring the treats. It will be so great to have you back; I've been alone in the house for too long now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't know if it makes it easier or harder to sleep without you when I listen to those old love songs on Classy 100, but I keep coming back to them, and one song or another is always on my mind. I especially understood what Paul Young was singing about today as I puttered around the kitchen: ""Every time you go away, you take a piece of me with you."" Whenever you go away you take a piece of me with you, too, because wherever you go, my heart soon follows. Hurry home, Sweetheart! I miss you so much!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am forever yours."|I keep telling myself that soon things are going to get easier, and that one of these days I'm not going to miss you so much. When we started seeing each other, I never thought that your being in the Air Guard would affect my life as much as it has. Back then, your service in the army meant a weekend apart each month, but then I got to see you in a gorgeous dress uniform from time to time. Things have really changed now that you've been over in Afghanistan for more than two months, and being apart just hasn't gotten any easier.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I lie awake at night, all I can think about is how much I want to be in your arms again to just be able to hold you close. I remember the time that we've spent together, and the things that we've done. I think about the times we spent playing checkers, and surfing at the beach, going biking, reading poetry--I miss it all. During the days, I spend my time daydreaming about what we could do if you were home--it's a wonder I get any work done at all. I think of all the places that I want to visit, all that I want to do, but none of it seems appealing without you. In the meantime, I long for the day when I can have you home safe to share my days and nights.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was thinking that when you get home, we can take that trip to Alaska that we've been talking about. I know you'll definitely be ready for some time off, and for cooler climes, and my friend told me about an ad she saw recently for a week-long cruise along the Alaskan coast. Doesn't that sound good? It would be the perfect opportunity to get away and spend some time together. Then, after we get back, of course, we can catch up on all of the movies you've missed lately, and I can't wait to start rock climbing as we planned. I even went to the library and took several books out on the subject. Then I went to The Outback Warehouse and bought some rock climbing gear so I'll be all ready to go when you get back.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyway, I can't wait for you to get home. I just hope that the next two months won't drag on quite as badly as these last two have. The thought of being back together is what keeps me getting out of bed each day. I'm very interested to know, too, how things went. You don't write a lot about what's going on over there in your e-mails, and I don't blame you. When you get home, though, I hope that you'll feel comfortable telling me about some of your experiences. No matter what, I hope you know how much I love and support you. You mean everything to me, and I pray every day for your safe return.|This evening I sat by myself at the dinner table pushing canned beans around the plate with a fork. When they were too cold to eat, I sat back and watched the clock tick off seconds as though they were minutes. Can you tell that I'm becoming a wreck because I'm missing you so badly? Later, I tried to watch TV hoping to focus my mind on something else, but the program was a love story set in World War II--you know: soldier meets girl, they fall in love, he is shipped off and dies bravely in battle holding a photo of her. Now I'm in bed crying and writing you this letter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Unfortunately, this is more usual than not. My morning starts at six. After I turn off the alarm, I instinctively reach for you but find a hole in the bed. Then I remember that you are gone. I flip on the light switch, adjust my eyes, grope for the calendar, cross off another day, and count the remaining days until you return. Aimlessly, I dress, try to force down some toast, and go to work. At least I can stay busy for a few hours. But break time and lunch are hard--that's when we usually call each other. Instead, I sit by myself and read one of those grocery store tabloids to get the latest on the 500-pound alien baby and who's divorcing whom--all very uplifting! I can't wait for you to come home! Please hurry before I go insane!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've started making a plan for your homecoming. I've purchased some candles and a lace tablecloth. During all my television watching, I decided to do something constructive, so I turned to the food channel and have been learning how to make some delicious French dishes. (Come home hungry!) Then I found some French music--very authentic, and very seductive! Do you remember the satin negligee I wore on our wedding night? Well, I retrieved it from a storage box and washed it carefully by hand. It still fits, which pleased me beyond words. You can let your imagination wander. We've got a lot of catching up to do.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Then, over the weekend, I booked a cabin in the mountains. You can tell me about your trip. I want to hear every detail. I want to be with you and breathe the mountain air and hold your hand and become reacquainted. I miss you so much. I need you back; I want you back.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm going to sleep now with the thoughts of candles, French food, French music, a satin negligee, a cabin in the mountains, and YOU on my mind. I love you with all my heart!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Until then, I am forever yours.|You've been gone for two weeks now. I look at the calendar and know that it's only 14 days, but those 14 days feel so much longer! We've never been separated from each other for this long before. I knew that it would be difficult, and I knew that I would miss you, but I didn't realize how difficult being separated from you this long would really be!<br><br><br><br><br><br>The worst part is at night. I put off going to bed as long as I can, but eventually I have to end up in bed all alone. When I reach my arm out for you in the night, there's nobody there. I only feel a cold sheet. Although I thought I might like being able to have all of the blankets, I would give them up in a heartbeat if you were just next to me again. I have no one to say goodnight to, no one to kiss before turning out the light, and no one to tell what my day was like at supper time. Talking on the phone is just not the same as talking to you in person with my arm around you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When exactly are you coming home? I can't wait to see you again. When I pick you up at the airport, we can go out to dinner. I want to hear all about your trip, about what went right and what went wrong. I want to hear about your hotel and the room service, about the weather, about the people you worked with while you were there. I want to hear every little detail. I have a lot to tell you, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm so excited to see you again, to talk to you, and to hold you. We can snuggle up on the couch and watch that new movie that's out on video that we've been looking forward to. I just need to be with you again. Please come home soon.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
783|Love||I'd like to get to know you better. (Do you remember me?)|I've looked forward to writing you since we met at the Fleetwood Mac concert last week. Thanks for being willing to give me your address.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ever since I let you cut in front of me in the line at the concession counter, I've been remembering those gorgeous eyes and that beautiful smile of yours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The reason for my letter is to extend you an invitation for dinner next Friday, assuming you're free and available. If you're interested, please call me at 555-5555.|I'll always be grateful to Brian for inviting me to his party last night because meeting you became the highlight of my evening. I'm also grateful he was willing to pass you this note in his English Lit. Class. I hope that you remember me. I was the one with the buzz cut and my mind was on the tests we're running in my statistics class.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although we didn't spend much time together at the party, it was long enough for me to find out that we have a few things in common. How many girls today think that the graduate statistics class is interesting and something they want to talk about? I was happy to find one who was comfortable discussing the differences between a Tukey's test and an items analysis--for a little while, anyway! And I bet you don't know too many guys who watched Pride and Prejudice on public television and enjoyed it--well, most of it! I still need you to explain to me exactly who was proud and who was prejudiced.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was hoping we could get together on Friday for lunch in the campus cafeteria and discuss it--my treat. I'll call you the day before to see if you can make it. Brian also gave me your phone number--I hope you don't mind. I'd really like to see you again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>P. S. I'm sending this with the hope that you are unattached and actually want to see me again. I may be only dreaming (if I am, please be kind).|I'm so glad that I met you last week at the football game. Jan introduced us during halftime--I was the one with the rival team's sweater, remember? I was instantly impressed by your open, easygoing manner and your dazzling smile!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we didn't get much of a chance to talk that day, but I was very intrigued by your views on college athletic programs. Do you think that we could go out to dinner sometime (Dutch treat) and talk some more about the benefits of allotting funds to core curricular programs versus extracurricular activities? I'm sure we'll find other things to talk about as well. I would really enjoy getting to know you better.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please give me a call if you're interested. I can be reached at home at 555-5555, or feel free to call my cell phone at 555-5555. I hope to hear from you soon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S. Jan gave me your address and mentioned you probably aren't seeing anyone seriously right now.|"I normally avoid bowling. Rolling a bowling ball into a gutter nine times out of ten is not my idea for fun. But I'm glad Bill invited me to bowl last Friday night--otherwise I would not have met you. By the way, I'm the tall, uncoordinated guy who was wearing the striped socks and couldn't manage to break 90--but we had fun, didn't we?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you won't think I am too bold by saying that I really enjoyed being with you. I love your sense of humor and how you immediately made me feel at ease. I was also fascinated by your knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars--a longtime interest of mine. I've often wanted to meet someone who could talk intelligently about that era of history. I went home that Friday evening thinking that you and I must have many more common interests--besides our obsession with bowling, I mean. Dinner, for example.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Over the last few days I have asked myself, ""I wonder if she likes lobster or steak? Does she prefer salad or rice? Does she fold her napkin diagonally or rectangularly?"" These are questions that beg an answer. And I can think of only one way to find out. I propose that we get to the bottom of the ""dinner"" issue by my inviting you to Marie's Restaurant this Saturday night. We could also resume our discussion about Napoleon--there are at least three more years that we need to explore. Afterwards, I was thinking about taking you to see Oklahoma!...unless you would rather go bowling.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please say yes! Bill gave me your cell number. I'll call you on Thursday. I'd really like to see you again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Until then!<br><br><br><br><br><br>P. S. I've assumed that you are not involved with anyone. I hope not, because I think we could have an enjoyable evening together."|"When you walked into my office yesterday, I couldn't help but think to myself, ""Wow, I did something right today!"" The impression you left was unforgettable, although you are probably trying to remember now who I am among all the attentive men you met when you were here. I was wearing the navy suit with the yellow striped tie. You mentioned that you liked the California coast photograph hanging on my wall. ""There's nothing like Dana Point Harbor at sunset,"" you said. I remember your words exactly and have to agree.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although our encounter was brief, I thought of you immediately when I came into work this morning. I was attracted to your friendly professionalism, confidence and (I must admit) your stunning, bright smile. We have never had such an eye-catching, copier-repair person come to the office before! I also couldn't help but think about our common affection for Capistrano.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have been wondering when you became personally familiar with Dana Point, and think we should discuss it over dinner this weekend. I'm taking a chance here, as you may currently be involved with someone else, but it is clear that I will get no work done today until I ask. I have your number on the business card you left and will call you next Wednesday. Hopefully this letter will have found its way through your office mail system by then and my call will not be a surprise.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I look forward to Wednesday.<br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S. I can't just sit here waiting until the copier jams to get you back, and I don't think the secretary will be very happy if I jam it myself!"|I really enjoyed Chris's New Year's Eve Party--especially after I met you. I hope you remember me. I was the one who helped you find your coat as you were leaving. The few minutes I was able to spend with you became the high point of my evening. Your beautiful smile and contagious laugh really made an impression on me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I would really like to see you again and hope you feel the same. How meeting me for dinner on Friday at this nice little restaurant I know? If you're free, please give me a call and we'll work out the details. My number is 555-5555.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Looking forward to hearing from you,|I didn't think I was going to like Gary's barbeque last Saturday night, but everything changed when he introduced me to you. I hope you remember me. I am Gary's younger sister, Rachel. You might remember me from the grilling incident with the steaks. When my brother introduced you to me, he neglected the cuts of beef and, well, you know the rest of the story. I never had a top sirloin that was so very well done! The entire mishap proved to be a nice icebreaker, however, and I still laugh when I think about it. It was fun to be able to relax and get to know someone new.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I also wanted to tell you how refreshing it was to meet someone so strong and confident and yet, at the same time, so down-to-earth. You've really got a great sense of humor, too, and reminded me that life doesn't have to be so serious--even when things go wrong! I really enjoyed talking to you as we sawed away at our charbroiled steaks! I can't remember when I've had so much fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because the barbeque ended a little early, I didn't get a chance to learn whether or not you were seriously involved with anyone else. With the hope that you might be free this Friday evening, I thought I'd ask you to meet me for dinner so we could get to know each other a little better. My favorite restaurant is Octavio's. It is a quaint little diner right in the center of town. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. Dinner will be my treat, so I hope you will accept my invitation. Please give me a call at 555-5555.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I look forward to hearing from you soon.|I don't know if you remember me, but we met in English Literature class last semester. I sat directly behind you. You may remember me because I was usually late and bumped my book bag past you to get to my seat. I've thought about you a lot since the semester ended.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You weren't shy about offering your opinion in class and I enjoyed your comments. I thought they were intelligent and very insightful. I also enjoyed the small talk before and after class and your jokes always made me laugh.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'd really like to get to know you better. I don't know what your situation is, but I'd love it if we could meet for dinner one night. Perhaps next Friday night at 7:00 at Chili's? I'll check with you tomorrow to see if you're interested.|Do you remember meeting me at the company function last week? I was the man sitting next to you trying to listen to the speaker, and hoping you wouldn't notice that my eyes kept wandering to you, your flawless face, and your flowing hair. It has taken me a week to find the right words to express what is in my heart, to compose these words that I hope will capture the sincere feelings of my heart. It is my fervent hope that we can get to know each other. You have been in my thoughts constantly since I met you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After meeting you only once, my heart and my world have changed. I know from our brief meeting that we have much in common in our work and our love of life. Heaven must be missing an angel, because you are here on earth, a vision of loveliness. It would be a great honor to meet you again, if for nothing more than to see if your wings are attached.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please write back if you will consider giving me the privilege of phoning you to set up a date.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Finally, I hope I've gotten the words right. I'll be praying that heaven doesn't call you back before I hear from you. My dreams will be of you, my angel.|||||||||||||||||||||||
784|Love||I'll do whatever it takes. (Just please come back.)|"It's been over two weeks since I came home from work and found your note on the table. Now when I come in the door, I always look at that same spot on the table and remember how my heart stood still when I read that you were leaving me and going to your mother's house. I was overcome with surprise and amazement then, because I didn't know how you could do such a thing to me, or what I could have possibly done to deserve it. Even though you had threatened to leave me before, I never really took you seriously. But the lonely reality of living in an empty apartment for fifteen days and three hours has forced me to consider what provoked you to leave me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The biggest problem, I think, is that nasty temper of mine. When I get hungry or tired, I start snapping at the person who least deserves it. It would be easy to say ""I'm sorry,"" but I know I've said that before, usually after I've had one of your delicious dinners and my hungry irritation gives way to warm satisfaction and a feeling of remorse. I'm going to do much better this time, Sweetheart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>First of all, I've made an appointment at the clinic to get a check-up and I'll tell the doctor about my fits of temper. Maybe he'll say I need to take a pill. Do you think they make any anti-temper pills? Also, you've been saying for a long time that we should go to a marriage counselor. I'm willing to do that now and anything else that you think would help because I don't want to lose you. Your leaving has made it clear that my behavior is unacceptable and I have learned my lesson. If you will give me another chance, I promise things will be different now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Even if my behavior doesn't always show it, I love you with all my heart and miss you so much. Do you miss me a little, too? What do you think about making a fresh start? We could mark the occasion by going out to dinner tomorrow night. If you'd like, we could go to Tony Roma's--I think we both have good memories of that place. My optimistic plan is to come by tomorrow and pick you up at 6 p.m. If you decide to give me another chance, just put the porch light on. If it isn't on, I'll know you're not ready to see me yet, and I'll keep on going.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Missing you!"|When you called me at work and said that you had moved out, I couldn't believe it. Even now, after almost two months, it's still hard to accept the fact that you're really gone. When you left, I was upset that you would just leave that way, without even telling me good-bye in person. I was angry and hurt. And that's why I haven't gotten in touch with you sooner. It's definitely not that I haven't missed you--believe me, I have.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Over the last few weeks I've taken some time to evaluate our relationship, and I now feel like I understand why you felt that you had to leave me the way you did. I hadn't been giving you enough of my time--or rather, I hadn't been giving enough time to us. I know that I kept promising to cut back my hours at the hospital, and I really meant to. You've said that you didn't feel like you were in a relationship at times, and I don't blame you. If you hadn't shocked me into action by ending our relationship, I probably would have just kept going as I had been for the last couple of years. The ER room had become my life; I felt like I was literally on call all the time. Add to that my volunteer work in the pediatric ward, I might as well have taken up residence at St. John's.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know now, even more than before, that as much as I love my work at the hospital, you are far more important to me than my profession. I talked to our director and told her that I couldn't put in anymore overtime, and so she agreed cut back my hours to three twelve-hour shifts each week. I also told the head nurse in the pediatric ward that I would only be coming in to volunteer two hours a week from now on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If you meant what you said about loving me and not wanting things to end, then I hope you'll give us another chance. You mean the world to me, and I promise I'll prove it to you this time. I've learned my lesson, and I won't ever take you for granted again. You deserve the best that I can give, and that's what you're going to get.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you so much. I'm sorry if I haven't always manifested that love as I should have. If you're willing to start over, though, I'll make it up to you. I'll begin by making your favorite food for dinner--beef enchiladas with all the trimmings--and your choice of dessert. Give me a call if you're interested and we can get together this weekend.|I wish I could turn back the clock. I wish I could turn back a lot of things. Sixteen days ago, when you walked out the door, I felt that time stood still. Was it possible? Why hadn't I seen it coming? Since then, I find myself glancing at the door with the faint hope that you'll be walking through it. I sit in silence, straining for echoes of you resounding from the walls, but the silence is deafening. And I know why you left.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's my temper. I've always struggled to tame it, but mostly I've failed. When it has boiled, you've often been in its path and taken the brunt of its cruelty, which has made me realize that I can't harness it alone. Your leaving has helped me to make a hard decision--I need some professional help. I want you to know that I've made an appointment with a counselor and that I start on Monday. I realize that my delay (or denial) has put my most precious relationship in jeopardy--you. My promise to you is that I will continue in counseling until I become master of my emotions. I'll do whatever it takes to change my life and save our marriage.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You have always been patient with me. You have stood by me when you were hurt and frustrated. You have given me hundreds of second chances. Can you find it within yourself to give me one more? Facing the difficulty of change, I need you more than ever. I know that you have had to be the strong one, and I know that I am asking you to be the strong one for a little longer, but I promise that I will work hard so that I am pulling my equal weight in the relationship. I know I can make this right if you'll help me. I know this will be the fight of my life, but I am committed to the process no matter how long or how hard it may be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you--although I admit that my actions have not always communicated that. Nevertheless, I love you with all my heart. I miss you so badly. Please believe me when I say that my weaknesses do not define my love. I want you and no other woman. Please give me another chance to prove it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Would you agree to see me again? We've had a lot of good memories at Marie's Restaurant. Without seeming presumptuous, but with the hope that you would say yes, I made tentative reservations for this Saturday night at eight o'clock. I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. I just wondered if we could have an enjoyable evening in that beautiful setting while I try to verbalize my heartfelt apology and discuss my plans for counseling. I need you and love you. Please come!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Missing you!|The day I found out you were leaving me was the worst day of my life. I felt lost, alone, and hopeless. Now, having been separated from you these past few weeks, I have felt more sadness and pain than I could ever imagine. I blame myself completely and can see how I've driven you away. I completely understand your reasons for leaving.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm sorry I've taken so long to realize how many ways I've hurt you and taken you for granted. I see that I let my work become more important than our marriage, but I assure you that now I am getting my priorities in order. Without you in my life, my work has little meaning, anyway. I hope you'll give me a chance to prove this to you. For example, I no longer remain at work past 6 p.m. I leave punctually at 5 and imagine I'm going straight home to you. If you will come back to me, I promise to be home for dinner! I want us to spend more time together and will pay better attention when you want to talk.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For several years, you've wanted us to move into a smaller house and a friendlier neighborhood. You've specifically talked about the new Midvalley community. I realize I've been selfish by insisting that we stay here, but now I'm ready to move anywhere that you will feel more comfortable. I've actually checked with real estate agents in Midvalley and have sent out resumes to employers in that area so I could work closer to home and avoid the long commute.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I look back on the way I've treated you and misplaced my priorities, I feel deep remorse. Although saying I'm sorry doesn't seem adequate, please let me hold you in my arms and tell you how sorry I really am. The one constant in my life, despite my actions, is my love for you. I've never stopped loving you and I never will. You are worth fighting for, even if the fight is with myself. Please give me another chance. I hope you can see that I'm truly trying to change and am taking active steps to adjust my schedule. You're more important to me than every other consideration. I want to prove this to you with more than promises and show you that I am deeply committed to making you happy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please accept my invitation to take you to dinner at Minghella's this Saturday evening. We've shared so many wonderful memories at this restaurant. Remember when we ordered lobster and crab on our first date? Let's order lobster and crab again. Let's remember why we fell in love in the first place. I know our love is still alive; it just needs a little nourishing. I want to show you we can be happy again and that our happiest times are yet to come. Please forgive me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you. I need you. I love you.|I remember exactly where I was when you told me you were leaving. I was sitting in the chaise by the fireplace. I was reading that new Mary Higgins Clark mystery. I remember that I was wearing my black skirt and green cardigan. I don't know why I remember all the details. But the detail that I remember the most was how I felt. I felt as if my heart jumped and turned over and I was left with this cold fear in the pit of my stomach.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't say that I was totally surprised. Our relationship had been suffering for awhile, but I naively thought that because we loved each other, it would get better with time. I thought it was just a bump in the road that we would get over.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since you've been gone, though, I've thought a lot about it, and realize now that things were worse than I let myself believe. I knew that you weren't happy. Instead of trying to talk about it and deal with it, I chose to brush it under the rug and hoped that it would go away on its own. But instead, you went away. I realize now how selfish I was and how I always considered my own wants and needs before yours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to come back. I am willing to put forth whatever effort required to make things work. Let's talk about it. Let's go see a counselor if you think that's a good idea. I promise that things will be different this time. I'll focus on being much less selfish and considering your wants, your needs and your feelings. I know I may not have always acted like it, but I love you. I love you more now since the separation because I realize what I had and how much I have lost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please, let's meet and talk about it. Let's meet at the city park where we had our first date. I'll pack a picnic lunch and we can talk about getting back together. I really want to see you again. How about Saturday at 2 pm? I'll be waiting for you under that large willow tree.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||
785|Love||I'm falling for you. (We're made for each other!)|Ever since our first date, I've noticed changes in my world. Work at the office seems easier, and I'm getting more accomplished in less time. My boss has noticed the changes, too, and has been very complimentary of late.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I continue to be pleasantly surprised as I discover more about you, yet there is still so much that I'd like to know. I get excited at the thought of spending more time with you because our time together will help me to learn more about you. Already, I'm learning that we have so much in common. I enjoy our differences, but I'm happy that we share so many similar opinions and experiences. Whatever differences exist can only broaden our horizons and our outlook on life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've lost interest in seeing anyone else, Katie, because I'm falling in love with you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S. I hope we can get together Friday evening. I'll call you.|Is it my imagination or am I getting smarter? I think the glow from your electric personality must be energizing my brain as well as my heart. I aced my statistics test on Monday--even after we were out so late on Sunday night. All the more surprising as your pretty face kept coming up between my calculator and all the formulas I had to deal with!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I like to think I'm getting to know you better each time we go out, but the truth is you're still full of surprises. I didn't expect to hear that you not only studied German and Russian, but you aced a statistics course too! I'd really like to read the results of all your statistical tests in your thesis when you finish your first draft. And if you need any help, I'm your man! Stats is a language I'd be happy to converse in any time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>That's the great thing about this relationship--we have so many things in common, like politics and hiking (and statistics!), but each of us also has interests that are out of the other one's familiar world. This makes the time we spend together especially interesting and helps us widen our worlds a little, too. I was surprised to hear you had never played chess before, but you really showed a knack for it when we played together on Saturday night and you beat me! I demand a rematch! And I was amazed to learn about the importance of intonation in nonnative comprehension of English. I need another lesson, though, because I still don't understand the difference between segmentals and suprasegmentals!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you know how much I enjoy being with you. My feelings for you keep growing all the time. I've run into a few girls I've gone out with a few times before (before you!), but I'm really not interested anymore. I find myself thinking only about you (and less about statistics) and not wanting to see anyone else. I hope you're starting to feel the same way about me, too. Let's get together on Saturday evening--please tell me that's become our regular date night! I'm looking forward to another chess game with you as well as another lesson in phonology.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With love and anticipation...|I wish I could really express the happiness I have found in spending time with you over the last few weeks. Getting to know you has brought a dimension to my life that it just never had before. Every time we are together, the world looks a little better and the sun shines a little brighter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm not exaggerating when I say that you're the kindest, most animated, and most amazing person I have ever met. The more I learn about you, the more I want to know. You're incredible! You have, in a way, changed the way I see the world. I am a better person, and I want to be an even better person, just because I have known you. I'm so glad that your love for humanity matches my own. I was serious about joining the Peace Corps, if you really want to go!<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's not just our desire to serve others, though. I love that you enjoy playing sports and spending time in the great outdoors as much as I do. I can't wait to do some hiking and backpacking together this summer. When are we going to take that trip down the Colorado that you talked about? I still can't believe you've already gone down it ten times, and yet you say that it's a new adventure each time. Well, that's how I feel every time that we go out together. Every day that I'm with you is full of bright hope and offers a new adventure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't wait to see you again. I hope you know how much you're starting to mean to me. The other girls I've dated in the past just fade in comparison. You're quickly becoming the only one for me. I hope that I will soon be the only one for you.|Before I met you, I had never taken much notice of flowers or dew or grass or birds. But this morning I walked outside, breathed in the crisp, spring air, sat quietly on the porch, and watched life happen. Then, when time forced me back into the real world, I arrived at work and tried to concentrate, but couldn't. When I looked at my computer screen, I saw your beautiful face and when I jotted notes, I found myself printing your name. Even when I broke for lunch, I remembered our date, the smell of your hair, your perfume, your playful laugh. Everywhere I looked, I remembered you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Since I met you, my world is coming alive. The more I get to know you the more I feel something warm and beautiful stirring within me. Is this feeling what poets have struggled to describe as love? All I know is that I feel happy and complete when I am with you. When we are apart, I am lethargic and unfocused. I find myself watching the clock as it ticks off the moments until we can be together again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I learn something new with every conversation. I am impressed that you can easily converse about Bach one moment and French cuisine in another. I was so pleased to learn that we share a common interest in educating children. I have often wondered if I was alone in my thinking, but you confirmed that these ideas might have real merit. That's just the point: you're full of surprises--I never know what new and wonderful thing I will learn when I'm with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please pardon my awkward attempt at saying how much I treasure our growing relationship. I hope you feel the same way. The girls I've dated in the past are like vague memories. I've totally lost interest in anyone but you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've planned a surprise for our date this Saturday night, but I'm only giving one hint--please wear a formal dress. That's all I'll say for now. I hope you can come. I'll call you tomorrow night.|"I know you are staying late at the office tonight, but I wanted to tell you about my incredible day. I thought a letter wouldn't disturb you too much. It seems there have been many reminders of you in the air today. It all started when I woke up early to go to aerobics. When the instructor began the warm-up music, what should I hear but Tiffany's ""I Think We're Alone Now."" Because we talked about our mutual passion for '80s music last night, I thought of you immediately. I'm glad you have such great taste in music! I also remembered how you sang ""Love Shack"" in your car the first time we went out, and it got my heart rate up quickly this morning. I had an exceptional work out!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Later, in the office, I received several comments from co-workers who told me that I have been particularly efficient and energetic since we started spending time together. I love being a hygienist and I was thrilled to find out that you have spent time in the dental field yourself. I am learning new things about you all the time. I think the excitement of my growing feelings for you has not only helped me at the office, but has also improved my outlook on life in general. You are on my mind constantly and my days are more fulfilling.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I stopped at a red light while I was on my lunch break, I found myself surrounded by a group of cyclists. I thought of you again! Normally I wouldn't have given them a second look, but now that you have taught me all kinds of new things about biking, I was much more interested in them. I pictured you riding along in your fluorescent yellow biking outfit. I love how you have many unique interests and that you are willing to share them with me. We are broadening each other's horizons as we spend more and more time together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>An old friend called me tonight asking if she could line me up with a guy she knows. Truthfully, the thought of spending time with anyone else didn't interest me. I quickly tried to think of an excuse to turn down my friend's suggestion because, after all, we haven't defined our relationship in terms of dating other people yet. I told her I couldn't be lined up with anyone right now because I'm seeing someone who is incredibly handsome. Do you like being with me as much as I like being with you? If so, should we consider only dating each other and seeing where our relationship could go?<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was funny how you made my day good, even though I didn't get to see you. It seemed like everything I heard and saw reminded me of you. I may be falling for you, Michael! We both deserve a break from work, so would you fall into my arms for a good movie tomorrow night? How about ""Lord of the Rings""? Give me a call and we'll work out the details.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am still thinking of you."|"Ever since I met you my life hasn't been the same. Knowing you is really bringing out the best in me and helping me to see the world through a rich, new lens. Although we have a lot in common, our differences are also important because they broaden our ranges of interest. Before I met you, I didn't think that classical music was something I could enjoy, but you showed me that I could and that has added a new dimension to my life. I've actually bought Handel's ""Music for the Royal Fireworks"" on CD to play in my car! I hope you are enjoying my ""Credence Clearwater Revival Greatest Hits"" CD as well! My boss has noticed the change in me, too. He tells me that I'm more energetic and that my work is more creative.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm falling in love with you. Dating other girls seems useless now because I have found what I want. My day isn't complete anymore unless I've seen you or at least talked to you on the phone. Could we go out on Friday night and carry this relationship a step further? I think dinner and a movie would be a good place to start, don't you? I'll call you tomorrow and we'll work out the details.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you already."|"You make me feel like singing--and I don't sing. You make me feel like dancing--even with my two left feet. When you're near me, my life is in focus. Everything I do is better because you believe in me. When the copy machine jams, I don't kick it anymore. When my computer crashes, I calmly reboot it without losing my temper. I even laughed today when the paper shredder jammed. My co-workers enjoy my new, relaxed attitude and send you their warmest regards!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Getting to know you is such an exciting adventure. Your creative problem-solving continues to pleasantly surprise me. Most of all, I enjoy so many things about you--the way you always crinkle your nose when you smile, and how you tilt your head and lower your eyes when I tell you you're beautiful.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Despite our individual natures, we seem to be cut from similar cloth. Most importantly, we share important values and beliefs. We have so much in common that we just feel right together. I love the fact that you follow a strong moral compass that always points you true North. Your strong personal standards are apparent in all that you do. These characteristics are important to me and serve as a strong foundation for our relationship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm beginning to feel that I'm learning so much since you've broadened my horizon. I've even started to gain a better appreciation of art and really enjoyed seeing your favorite museum last week and learning about modern art! Would you like to go to the Art Expo Friday night? You've got me anxious to see the ""surprise unveiling."" Please be patient, though, my seventh grade art teacher described me as ""artistically challenged.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm happy that you're letting me teach you the finer points of hockey, too. After the Art Expo, we could go to Calgary's playoff hockey game. I heard you cheering more loudly than I did when Conroy scored last game's winning goal! But when it comes right down to it, I'm happy going anywhere, so long as I'm with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've fallen head-over-heels for you, yet I've never felt firmer on my feet. There is no one else with whom I'd rather be. Our relationship offers me more than I could have ever imagined. It may sound corny, but it's true--you're the girl of my dreams.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'll call you Thursday to see if you're available. Please say, ""Yes."""|I've noticed something recently--I'm happy. My attitude at work has improved. My attitude about life has improved. I smile most of the time and sometimes I find myself humming as I walk down the street. Other people have noticed it too and asked me what's different now and what has made me so much happier. The answer? I can trace the change back to the time when I first met you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love spending time with you. The more I learn about you, the more I want to be with you. You make me want to try new things. Who would ever have thought that I would try rock climbing? I'm usually afraid of heights and afraid of falling, and yet there I was, halfway up the side of a mountain and enjoying it. I hardly felt scared at all!<br><br><br><br><br><br>We're so different and yet we're so alike. You're an extrovert and I'm more of an introvert. You love doing adventurous outdoor activities, and I tend to be afraid of doing anything out of the ordinary. Our political differences may lead to some heated discussions, but we also complement each other in so many other ways. We have the same quirky sense of humor and the same desire to learn new things. And we respect each other's opinions, whether we agree with them or not. I think I could talk to you nonstop for a week and not run out of things to say!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think I'm falling in love with you. I don't have any desire to be with anyone else; I just want to be with you. I hope that we can continue down this path and see where it leads. I can't wait until our next date.||||||||||||||||||||||||
786|Love||I'm glad we went out together. (I want to see you again.)|I had to let you know how much I enjoyed our date on Saturday. Just being out with you in the fresh air helped free me from all the worries of the past week. I've always enjoyed hiking, but going with you took my appreciation for it to a whole new level. Were you as surprised as I was that we could talk for hours and confide in each other so soon? I was impressed to hear about all the challenges you've met and overcome and how you didn't turn around until you stood at the peak of your career. It seems we both enjoy a good challenge as well as being out in nature. Conversation between us flowed so naturally at that little diner afterward that it seemed like we had already known each other for a long time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm looking forward to our next date and hope that you are too. I remembered that you like Baroque music and I was able to get tickets for us to a Vivaldi cello concerto at the Community Arts Center this Friday evening. I'd like to take you there and then to dinner afterwards. I'll call you tomorrow and we can work out the details.|"When I picked you up on Saturday night, I knew it would be a special evening as soon as I saw you! I got a kick out of your reply when I said how great you looked: ""Thanks, but didn't you think I would?"" I don't know what I expected, but the color of your blouse did amazing things to your eyes. As if they weren't amazing enough already! And you, Lindsey, you actually glowed when you entered the room! It was great spending the evening with you and getting to know you and your lively personality better.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I really enjoyed the movie, too. Did you? We seemed to laugh at all the same places, but I noticed you got a little teary-eyed when the boyfriend was sent off to war (I didn't join you there!). I wonder if you could ever care that much if they shipped me off to Iraq? One could only hope.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Afterwards, I really enjoyed talking with you as we sat on your front porch. I noticed we have the same political views. What a relief! Now we can have animated discussions about the economy and the war with no friction. You are certainly one of the most insightful, interesting, and straightforward people I have ever met and I hope I can see you again soon. I remember you said you liked to do a little hiking on the weekend, weather permitting. I do, too. What do you think of hiking up the canyon next Saturday--say around 2 pm? I'll spring for dinner afterwards. Do you like Italian! I'll call tomorrow to see if you're free--please say, ""Yes""!"|I'm glad you decided to give me a call. I had a really great time last night. I hope you did too. Dinner was fantastic, and the company was pretty good as well! The atmosphere was light, the live piano music was perfect, and the dessert was out of this world. You really know how to pick 'em. I had a great time walking around the city afterward--I never realized how much there is to do in this small college town!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you don't mind that I picked your brain so much. You have such a wealth of knowledge on a wide variety of topics, and I'm always curious to hear what you'll say next. I was particularly amused, though, by the stories you told of your childhood ramblings on your grandfather's farm in the summer. You sure did know how to get into trouble! Do you still? I was also glad to hear that you are so close to your sister and to your parents. Family is really important to me, too, and I'm happy that we both have something so fundamental in common.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Well, I look forward to going to that movie you mentioned. It sounds like it will be really good. Just give me a call and we can set up a time.|"I don't know about you, but I'm always a bit nervous on a first date. I could tell you some horror stories...maybe another time. But I felt so at ease with you! From the moment you opened the door, I knew we were going to have a wonderful time. I have to tell you that I almost fell over when you told that joke about the frog. I've found myself laughing out loud every time I think of the punch line. But that's what I mean--you're just fun to be around.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And you looked great! You've got beautiful eyes that can light up a room. Once in a while I noticed other guys were staring at you the entire evening. They seemed very envious. I was so happy that you were with me. I also appreciated your insight into the poverty and ignorance problems of Third World countries. It is so rare to find someone that is so informed and caring. I can see why you are so valuable to your employer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was especially pleased to learn that you and I have a common passion for biking. I'm going to take your advice and try the mountain trails that you mentioned. I'm also going to try the high protein breakfast that you ""invented."" I could use a little lift to start my day out right.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I bet you have lots of good ideas. We just didn't have enough time to explore them all. But that can be remedied. This is my awkward way of saying that I'd really like to see you again. With the hope that you would say yes to another date, I made reservations at Marie's Restaurant (you mentioned that you love seafood) for this Friday night at 7 p.m. Afterwards, I purchased tickets for a special benefit viewing of ""The African Queen."" It's a classic love story and the proceeds go to charities for education in Africa. I thought you'd like that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'll call Thursday to see if you're free.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope to see you soon!"|After you dropped me off last night, I haven't stopped thinking about our day together. I wanted to tell you again how much fun I had. Now I can tell you how nervous I was when you mentioned your plans to take me boating. My stomach is prone to motion sickness and has provided me with a few embarrassing moments (including an accident involving my new satin shoes...I'll spare you the details)! Fortunately, I didn't have time to think about my problem because your company was so enjoyable. The bay was so serene that it felt like we were the only two people for miles.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our conversation was really satisfying for a first date! I was surprised to find that we both have had similar experiences supporting humanitarian aid to Africa, and our discussion on that topic was enlightening. We covered everything from the Tour de France to your grandmother's homemade spaghetti! I really felt like we connected. You are open-minded and thoughtful, two qualities that benefit any type of relationship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I loved spending time getting to know you and sharing some of your interests. I think that now we have spent a day in the great outdoors, it is time for you to see a city girl in her element. How about using the theater tickets I bought for Saturday night? Have you seen the play Les Miserables? It is heart-warming, yet intellectual, and will stimulate an excellent discussion at the Garden Caf over dinner. The food won't compare to the delicious picnic you packed yesterday, but they have the best organic desserts in the city. I'll call you Thursday night to see if you are ready for a night on the town.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks again for yesterday!|"Going to the observatory on Saturday evening was really a wonderful idea, and it became the highlight of my week. I haven't been there since I was a child and it was fascinating to learn so much about our solar system and the universe. I was impressed because you not only knew the names and locations of the constellations, but also so many ancient myths about them. I really enjoyed having you share all this with me. Instead of feeling insignificant in relation to it all, I actually felt special. I'm sure what I felt had less to do with the galaxies and more to do with whose company I was in.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You have a gentle and sincere way about you that made me feel so much at ease and helped me to open up and not be as reserved as I usually am. I enjoyed conversing with someone who is well-educated and down-to-earth. You certainly have a way of putting life into perspective, and I mean that in a positive way. It was refreshing to see how optimistic you were and how you tend to see the glass half-full. I appreciated how open you were to new ideas, and I felt we began to develop a mutual respect for each other as we shared thoughts and opinions--and some of our dreams and ambitions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I enjoyed being with you and would really like to see you again. The Grand Heights Theater has just opened its production of ""Twelfth Night."" I have connections that could get us terrific box seats, and there is a nice Italian restaurant nearby where we could have dinner afterwards. I think you'll love it. It's within walking distance and passes through a scenic, residential area. Would Friday work for you? Please give me a call and let me know if you are interested.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Looking forward to seeing you again."|I just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know how much I enjoyed our date last Saturday. Going miniature golfing was a great idea! It's something I've always wanted to do and, unlike a movie, it also gave us time to talk and get to know each other better. I've never known anyone else who loves Heavenly Hash ice cream as much as I do!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't remember the last time I've laughed that hard. You have a great sense of humor. You have a great way of telling stories so that they're funny all the way through and lead up to a great punch line. I was also impressed with your honesty and forthrightness, especially when talking about some of the difficulties your family has been through. We had a very interesting conversation, that's for sure.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It seems like we have a lot in common. We're both still maturing, we're both originally from the East Coast but love the West Coast; and we seem to have similar goals for the future. But considering the differences in some of our opinions, I think we could also have some healthy debates!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I would really like to see you again and continue getting to know you. Maybe we could get together for dinner next weekend? I'll call to see if you're interested.|||||||||||||||||||||||||
787|Love||Let's part on good terms while we can. (It's time to go our separate ways.)|When my brother was a little boy, he used to bang his head against the wall whenever he was frustrated. My father would tell him that the best thing about banging his head against the wall was that it would feel so good when he stopped. I think it's time that we stop banging our heads against the unyielding wall that separates us, and maybe we will feel better, too. Five years, two separations, six months in counseling, and countless screaming matches have proven that we are hopelessly incompatible. This isn't necessarily a negative reflection on either one of us, but rather proof that the combination of fire and petroleum will produce a combustible mixture with predictable regularity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm afraid the passionate natures that brought us together in the first place are proving our undoing now. But life is too short to live with so much tension and stress, my Dear, and I'm sure it's unhealthy to do so. That's not to say that we still don't have our good times, but they continue to get fewer and farther between. Even when we are getting along fairly well, the anticipation of our next blow-up hangs over our heads like the sword of Damocles. Perhaps this is because we always feel like old issues have never been completely resolved.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Years of trying and numerous counseling sessions have not been able to teach us to speak the same language and understand what the other one is trying to say. If we attempt to have a serious talk about something, one of us usually gets offended where no offense was intended and the conversation goes downhill from there. Soon we're having another nasty scene filled with tears, tempers, and slamming doors. I don't believe it's possible to maintain a healthy relationship without productive interchanges and a certain amount of intimate rapport, do you? Unfortunately, we have proven many times that neither one of us can contribute either one of these peace-making abilities or anything else that is needed to live in peace and harmony.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think it's commendable that we have both stuck it out as long as we have, but neither one of us is happy or satisfied in this relationship on any level, and it should be clear to both of us by now that we never will be. Let's part now while we can still leave on reasonably good terms and wish each other well. I certainly wish you better luck in choosing your next love. I'm sorry I wasn't the right one.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I propose we make a pact to meet one year from today. Let's see if each of us is happier at that point than we are now--it could be a real eye-opener.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Fare thee well.|I know that we just decided (again) to work things out, but I just can't do this anymore. I had hoped that spending some time apart would help us gain a new perspective on our relationship and a greater appreciation for each other. When we decided to try again, I really thought that it had at first, but these last three weeks have proven otherwise. Things just aren't working for me and, if you're honest with yourself, you'll probably admit that they're not really working for you, either.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I had hoped that we would get back together and treat each other as we did when we first started dating. We treated each other so well then and put each other first in the relationship. We didn't let little things come between us then, either. After a few days of being back together, we're already squabbling again about stupid things--even more than before, it seems. Now we're hurting each other all over again and blaming each other for the problems between us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that living this way is hazardous to our mental well-being, and I'm not willing to do it anymore. I'm sorry. I really wish that things could have worked out this time. But we're not any better at working through our problems than we were before--we just don't seem to be able to understand each other or see eye-to-eye on anything. Whatever common ground we once shared has eroded.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that separating again (for good this time) will be hard on both of us. I regret the pain this letter will cause you, but it's the only way that we can find any lasting peace. I honestly believe we will both be much happier in the long run if we just end things now. It's clear we're not meant to be together, and the sooner we accept it, the sooner we can start rebuilding our lives.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish you the best, I really do. You'll always have a place in my heart. Maybe we can get together some time in the future, maybe this time next year, and catch each other up on our lives. We may be very surprised at the good that may come from this. Whatever happens, good luck, and take care of yourself.|I'm going to try to say what I think we have both been feeling for a long time. We've tried to make our relationship work--we've tried to the point of exhaustion. We've experimented with separation; we've employed a counselor; we've tried tiptoeing around each other--we've even tried screaming. But when every attempt at reconciliation has been said and done, we still end up in the same place where we started--miserable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I look in your eyes these days and see only frustration and fatigue. You're unhappy; I'm unhappy. We're both suffering some health problems. Poor sleep, loss of concentration. I've been feeling tightness in the chest and you have complained about stomach disorders. We are killing each other! Our communication has become so destructive that now we say little or nothing at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know where this is going. We can't stay together. We both know it, but one of us had to say it. This is our opportunity to preserve the good memories and have a civil conversation about parting gracefully. This is our chance to make a positive decision that will help each of us remain friends, regain our health, and move on with life. Despite all that we have gone through in recent years, we are not enemies and we must never become so. This is our time to make sure that we maintain something positive and step away from each other in dignity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let's don't prolong the inevitable any longer. Let's sit down and discuss our parting with the remembrance of the love we once shared. Then, let's move on with life positively--no more tears, no more hurt feelings, and no more accusations. Let's give each other what we both need most--peace and a new start.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And I hope we can stay in touch. No matter what our differences, you are a big part of my life. I will always be interested in your happiness. I hope we can communicate once in awhile and let the other know how life is faring. Maybe we could meet one year from today. I'll leave that decision up to you.|You know what? I'm surprised that this relationship has lasted as long as it has. I have never seen two more incompatible people in my life. It's like that old saying about trying to put a round peg in a square hole. It just doesn't work. And this relationship certainly hasn't worked. I think we both know that by now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We're so different. We can't agree on the simplest things, like even what to eat for dinner. You like Mexican; I like Italian. It seems like we fight more often than not. If it's not a full-fledged fight, then we're just constantly bickering. We don't like to do any of the same things, so we're spending less and less time together. Our opinions are so different that any attempt at communication seems to dissolve quickly into an argument.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Living like this is not healthy for either one of us. There's constant tension in the air whenever we're in the same room. I know that you feel the same way. We let this relationship go on too long as it is because neither one of us knew quite how to end it. But, now it's time we did. We need to go our separate ways and leave the stress behind us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'll be packed and out by Monday morning. Let's just try to remember the good times and wish each other well.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
788|Love||Please forgive me. (This relationship is worth saving!)|"I saw the look in your eyes today when you finally realized what I had done. Your pretty mouth dropped open slightly and you were at a loss for words. You didn't need to say anything, anyway, because I saw it all in your eyes--betrayal, disillusionment, revulsion. In that moment, I just wanted to crawl under a rock somewhere and hide. But now that I understand the gravity of what I've done, my actions have filled me with self-loathing and remorse. It's difficult for me to look in the mirror and I'm not proud of the man I see there when I do.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have no excuse for what happened and saying ""I'm sorry"" hardly seems adequate. But if you could forgive me this time, I promise you this will never happen again. Both the suffering that I've caused you and the misery I feel now show me that breaking my word causes too much damage to both of us to ever want to do it again. Whatever selfish gratification I thought I'd gain by my foolish act has disappeared like a wisp of cloud under the noonday sun. All that remains is guilt and a stronger resolve to be not only the man you want me to be, but to be the man that I want myself to be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know it may be difficult to believe right now, but I really do love you and have honestly never loved anyone else. In the past year, we've become so much a part of each other's lives that I really can't imagine my life without you anymore. I don't think it would benefit either one of us to give up on this relationship yet because we've both invested so much of ourselves into it already and our good times have far outnumbered the bad. What few problems we've had in the past have been minor and we've been able to work through them with very little trouble.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I would give anything to pick up where we left off--just doing everyday things like coming back to the apartment after work, kicking back on the couch and sharing the ups and downs of each other's day. I enjoy taking turns at being chef (when we don't order pizza) and appreciate your willingness to watch a game with me once in a while. We had already started to plan our summer vacation together before this happened. Wouldn't it be great if we could still get away together for a while and try to put this behind us?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know I'm really expecting a lot to ask you to continue making plans with me, but the alternative is too painful to even consider. Please remember all the good times we've had already, as well as all the good times that are still out there waiting for us to discover. I promise you a faithful companion who has learned his lesson and is more determined than ever to make you happy and stand by you as long as you will have him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know that you've gone to stay with Jan for the time being and I've given her this letter to deliver. I will call you there on Saturday afternoon and see if you would be willing to go out with me so we can have a serious talk. I can only hope..."|I'm really sorry that things kind of got out of hand the other night. Even though we feel very differently about the importance of budgeting and putting away money for a rainy day, I don't think it's something that should get between us. There are plenty of things that we do agree on, even when it comes to finances. I'm really glad that we see eye to eye on the importance of working hard, for example. It's more important to me that I know that with you I'll never have to worry if you'll pull your own weight when it comes to earning a living. You have such a strong work ethic (even if you do spend money as fast as you earn it) and that means so much to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know I have strong opinions about some things (and express them stronger than I realize sometimes), but we rarely have disagreements like that one. We have always talked things out in the past, and I feel bad that we left things as we did. But maybe we really did just need the time to cool off. I think it is normal, even healthy, that we have different ideas about things--think how boring it would be if we always thought the same about everything! As they say, variety is the spice of life. We just need to remember to keep things in perspective, and not to take things too seriously.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In any case, I apologize for anything that I said that offended you. I didn't mean it. I know that you really do understand my need for financial security. I love you, and that is the only thing that really matters. Everything else, big and small, will work itself out in time as long as we are willing to give our relationship our best efforts. Matt, thank you for being so good to me, and for being so patient with me. It means so much to me, and I love you for it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How about coming over to my place Friday for dinner? I'll make your favorite--chicken parmesan--and we can have that spinach salad that you like so much. Hot-from-the-oven French bread is always good, too, and dessert is negotiable!|"I know what I said hurt you deeply. The moment those words left my lips I knew that I couldn't act fast enough to retract them. Your reaction was justified. If someone whom I cared about had said such things to me, I would have reacted the same way. ""I'm sorry"" doesn't seem to be adequate. I wish I knew how to say it better. I've relived that moment over and over and wondered how I could have been so insensitive. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in myself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm nervous about asking you to forgive me. I'm sure that you've suffered a great deal because of me, and asking for forgiveness is so much to ask from you. I also know that you might find it hard to believe my promise that I will learn from my mistake and never repeat it. I truly never want to put our relationship on the line again. I hope you can believe that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Right now, I believe in ""us"" because of our past ability to work through our problems. I know we have never faced a challenge so difficult before, but I feel that we have been with each other long enough to know how to try. We know how to lift each other, forgive each other, and end up stronger. That ability can only come from love. And that is what I feel for you--a love than is deeper than I have ever known; a love that can close this wound.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you--please believe me. I love you for your giving nature, for helping me through finals, for staying up late and typing my thesis; for the long walks; for talking about dreams and fears and hopes and hurts. We've shared so much. Let's share healing, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Before this happened, we were planning a trip to the desert this weekend. I know it's a lot to ask, but I was thinking that it might be an ideal place to sort this out and give me a chance to make amends. If you'll come with me, I think we can bury this thing in the sand and come away happy, with our love intact--maybe stronger than before. Would you be willing to try? Can you give me another chance? I promise you will find a better me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will call you on Thursday at 7:00. Please be home. Until then, I will be hoping and praying we can put this behind us."|I am sorry. I don't want you to think that I'm saying those words lightly. I really mean them. I am so sorry. I know that what I did was wrong and I know that it hurt you deeply. I'm not sure what I was thinking, but I do know that I never wanted to hurt you. I wish I could take it back, but I can't. All I can do is try to show you how much I regret what I've done and ask for your forgiveness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you. We have certainly had our share of problems in the past, but we've always been able to work through them. I think we're actually stronger because of them. I hope that this situation is no different. I will do whatever it takes for you to trust me again, so that we can go back to the way things were.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We've had too many good times together to break up over this. I take full responsibility for my mistake, so please don't give up on me now. Remember the good times like when we went parasailing in Florida or when we bought our dog. Remember how happy we were? I know it can be that way again. Please forgive me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to see you this weekend. I want to start making it up to you. How about if I make dinner at my place and we rent a good movie? We can cuddle up on the couch under a big blanket and just enjoy being together. Think about it, and I'll call you tonight.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
789|Love||Sorry we didn't agree. (But can we kiss and make up?)|"Well, the inevitable has happened--we had our first real disagreement. But then, all fertile land needs a little thunder and lightning to produce the rain needed for growth (that's a wise old saying I just made up). At any rate, we made the classic blunder of talking about politics when we didn't know the other person's position on the issue. Remember the two areas of discussion that judicious Americans try to avoid--politics and religion? Now we know why. Perhaps, if one political party were not pulling against the other, we wouldn't have a proper balance in American affairs and things would be a lot worse. But we need to stay out of the fight because when it comes to the basic principles of right and wrong, I believe we're both on the same side, anyway. We just need to avoid labeling the ""right"" way of thinking as the exclusive property of any one political party or candidate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In any case, after I thought about it, I could see there were issues we both agreed on that were lost in the fervor of our ""discussion."" For example, I certainly agree with you that the loss of American lives in the war is a great tragedy and I want to see an end to the conflict as much as you do. The truth of the matter is that neither one of us will have any say in how or when that comes about, so there's really no use in causing tension between us by debating issues that neither one of us can really influence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We only have power here in our own little world, where we are the Senate and the Congress and can call all the shots. Fortunately, we usually agree on matters that directly concern us, both big and small. Anyway, I think it's an inevitable aspect of human nature that we will always have occasional disagreements, but that is as it should be. We don't want a king or queen dominating this relationship--we're better off with two equal partners, like the two-magistrate consul that ruled the ancient republic of Rome (yes, I'm studying World History this semester). So please, tell me your thoughts, your wishes, your differences of opinion. Let's create a balance of power that will help us think new thoughts and that will stretch our minds and spirits into areas we would never discover alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Before we begin again, though, please accept my apology if I was abrasive or rude to you when our war of words began to intensify. You already know that I have a strong personality--but that is why I was attracted to an independent thinker like you in the first place! I'm afraid now you also know my natural passion has a negative side as well. If you consider my good record, however, my behavior yesterday was, as they say, ""only a blip on the radar.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now I will tell you the best part of having a disagreement--the next step is for the offended parties to make up! I'm sure you will respect this time-honored American custom! How about if we begin by going out to Tony Roma's and having those baby-back ribs again? My treat. We could start the evening there, catch a movie, and then, perhaps, we could consider (as a consul) what should be next on our ""making up"" agenda.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm anxious to see you again. I'll call on Friday to see if you are ready to see me again, too."|I'm really sorry that things kind of got out of hand the other night.

We have always talked things out in the past, and I feel bad that we left things as we did. But maybe we really did just need the time to cool off. I think it is normal, even healthy, that we have different ideas about things--think how boring it would be if we always thought the same about everything! As they say, variety is the spice of life. We just need to remember to keep things in perspective, and not to take things too seriously.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In any case, I apologize for anything that I said that offended you. I didn't mean it. I know that you really do understand my need for financial security. I love you, and that is the only thing that really matters. Everything else, big and small, will work itself out in time as long as we are willing to give our relationship our best efforts. Matt, thank you for being so good to me, and for being so patient with me. It means so much to me, and I love you for it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How about coming over to my place Friday for dinner? I'll make your favorite--chicken parmesan--and we can have that spinach salad that you like so much. Hot-from-the-oven French bread is always good, too, and dessert is negotiable!|"I was caught off guard. I'm sorry it happened. Disagreements always give me a dull, dark feeling. I rehearsed the conversation over and over in my mind, but all I am left with is wishing it had never happened at all. Well, now we know something about each other--we each have passionate political agendas. My mother has always told me that politics is one of the two BIG subjects to avoid--that and religion!<br><br><br><br><br><br>In all the rehashing, however, I stepped away with an appreciation of your views on parental rights. You challenged me to read that article is Newsweek, and you were right. Legislation is the obvious answer. I hope we can chalk up the rest to differing opinions, which we have seldom had in the past. In fact, I think our views are remarkably in agreement and we share many interests in common--probably many more than most couples do. For example, we love the same kinds of food, nostalgic movies, songs from the '60s, and outdoor sports. I've really never met anyone who is so much like me in so many ways. Let's please consider the point of this disagreement the exception and not the rule.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Which brings me to my remarks: Clearly, I made my point badly. Somehow I let emotion dictate my vocabulary. I surprised (and mortified) myself by saying things that I have wished I could take back. I've learned this valuable lesson: no matter how strongly I may feel about a subject, I feel more strongly about you--and I believe in us. I know we can get past this and allow each other to have an opposing opinion. That's healthy, isn't it? Maybe we just need to work on the verbalizing part--I know I do.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please, let's get back to ""us."" Our disagreement was only that, a disagreement. I apologize for my part. Will you accept that? Will you let me say it in person? We can't allow this to drive a wedge between us. It is a subject, not the subject--we are the subject; our love is the subject. Let's not lose sight of that over some silly politics.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let's get back together--soon. I hope you won't think this is presumptuous, but with the hope that you would agree to see me again, I have made reservations for dinner at Gino's this Saturday night. And afterwards, I have rented Casa Blanca. Let's curl up on the couch and remember why we enjoy each other's company so much. I'll call you tomorrow. Please say yes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you."|Politics! If that's all we ever disagree about, then I think we're doing okay. I'm sorry about this last disagreement. Looking back now, it seems so silly. We hardly every fight like that! I know that I said some things in anger that I didn't mean and sincerely regretted very quickly. I hope you can forgive me and forget about it. I'm really sorry.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think that it can be a good thing that we have different opinions on some things. Don't you think it would get boring if we both always thought the same way about a subject? The way I look at it is, at least we feel comfortable enough with each other to be honest and express our true opinions. We usually have great communication; so what if we don't always agree? That's normal and it's bound to happen.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm really sorry for the mean things that I said. In the future, let's both try to express ourselves calmly without getting so upset if we disagree because that's when we say things we regret and feelings can get hurt. How about if we have dinner tomorrow night at our favorite Italian bistro and begin to forget about this whole thing?<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know I love you.|I cannot tell you how sad I now feel after our argument. Please forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have been! I wish that I could wash out any spot of unhappiness I have caused you. I know I have said hurtful things. I ask you to forget them, because the truth is that you a great person and I had no right to put you down.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will call you soon, but in the meantime, please try to forgive me. I am very sorry. Please give me another chance. I love you.|It looks like I have done it again--I upset our relationship and accused you of fooling around. I don't know why I get so crazy when you talk about your co-workers, but I do. I try to control my anger, but it goes out of control without my even thinking about what I am doing or saying.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You tell me that these are people you have to work with, and that you are only being pleasant, but it seems that you enjoy these other people too much; I know that is not a fair assessment, but that is the way it seems to me. I guess I am over-reacting, and I am sorry.<br><br><br><br><br><br>No matter what, I still love you, and I want to be with you. Please call so that we can talk and get on the right track.|This is hard for me to do because I am not good at saying I am sorry. We were having a lot of fun, and I know that I care for you very much, and I want to go on seeing you and being with you. Now I feel like I just want to start over and forget all of those angry words we both said.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Maybe this is just one of those lovers' quarrels that we hear about. We both said hurtful things. I did not like when you said that I am trying to control you. I was only trying to help you make up your mind about our relationship. I really love you and want to be with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If you feel the same way, let us make up and try to put this behind us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will call you unless I receive an email saying that you don't want to hear from me. I hope you do want to get together and make up.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Love and kisses.|||||||||||||||||||||||||
790|Love||Sorry, this isn't working for me anymore. (We need to separate for a while.)|"I'm writing you this letter because I'm afraid if I try to talk to you in person we'll start fighting. Lately, it seems if we manage to resolve one problem peacefully, we're soon arguing about something else. I don't know when this bickering first crept into our relationship, but it's been getting worse over the last two or three months. I've decided I can't continue our almost daily spats, saying things I soon regret and hearing things that become deeply etched upon my mind and heart. That is why I feel we need to separate, at least for the time being. I realize, though, that our lives are too interconnected for me to just disappear without letting you know that I'll be staying at Rachel's for the moment. If you need to get in touch with me, the phone number is on the refrigerator. I think it would better, though, if we could stay as incommunicado as possible for a while and make this separation a true experiment in living without one another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I honestly don't think that just one of us is to blame for all our problems, but together we combine to form a combustible mixture that blows up more and more frequently. The bad times are beginning to outnumber the good, and that's starting to affect my outlook on life even when we're apart. I go to work irritable after our grumpy exchange at breakfast and am soon snapping at my co-workers, who give each other warning looks when I come into the office now. I don't look forward to coming home anymore, either, and look around for extra work to do at my desk, even though you know I don't get paid for overtime there.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's a shame that this is happening to us because, when the pendulum swings the other way, there are no two people happier than we are. The kind of love we've known is not found by everybody and is certainly too precious to throw away without fighting to hold on to it. In other words, we can't just end our relationship and throw away all that we've built up together over the past three years until we know for sure where we stand. That is why I think the only wise solution is to separate for awhile and see if ""absence makes the heart grow fonder,"" or if our relationship is actually worn out and we find ourselves with a mutual case of ""out of sight, out of mind."" I'm afraid that only time and space will determine our true feelings. It's painful for me to leave you, Jerry, but I only have our best interests at heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am confused and disheartened."|I'm sorry that I didn't get in touch with you yesterday. I'm sure that you were surprised when you got home last night and found me (and some of my stuff) gone. A couple of days ago my friend Dan said he needed a house sitter for a few months while he went out of town on business, and when I mentioned that it might be good to have some time and space to myself for a while, he took me up on my offer to housesit for him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know as well as I do that things haven't been going very well between us lately. It seems as if we fight all the time. I don't even know if we really try to get along anymore. Every time we make an effort to resolve things, we just end up flinging insults and hurting each other more. We've stopped really listening to one another, and it's as if we've really stopped caring. We used to be so loving and good to each other, but now it seems as if all we do is count each other's imperfections. From time to time we try to make amends and make things better, but nothing seems to work.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now, I know that every coin has a flip side, so I'm certainly not blaming you for what has happened. The truth is that we're both at fault; I'm as much to blame as you are for the problems that we have. I just don't think this is a very healthy relationship for either one of us anymore.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I need some time to think about things and try to gain some perspective, so I feel that it would be best if we don't see each other for a while. That doesn't mean I think we shouldn't contact each other at all. You mean a great deal to me, Jodi, and I'll never forget the good times that we've shared. Things just aren't working out right now, and we need to find out if separating for the time being will help us to remember why we first got together. We might also discover that we would be better off just being friends, or maybe even ending the relationship altogether. In any case, whatever happens, please know that I love you, and that I want the best for you always.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Wishing you the best!|We have had so many arguments--especially lately--that I decided to write you this letter. It seems that we can't have a civil conversation. We use up all our energy bickering and then resolving, and now we don't even find resolution, we just walk away. If there were just one difficult subject, we could learn to avoid it and live in peace. But we tend to migrate from one issue to another, quarreling about anything and everything--which has brought me to a hard decision.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't live like this anymore. I need time to step away and try to discover how I feel about our relationship and our future. I've arranged to move in with my sister for now. Please don't worry about me. I know that we need to stay in touch, but for the time being, I'd appreciate your respecting my request that we communicate in writing. I don't want to get into the he said, she said stuff. If we see each other or talk by phone, we'll just end up arguing again, and that is what I am trying to avoid.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please understand that I'm not pointing fingers. I know there is plenty of blame on both sides. We don't need to make a bad situation worse by accusation. I only know that our constant snapping at each other is affecting my health. I find myself exhausted most of the time, yet I can't sleep at night. I'm concerned about my loss of appetite and the fact that I can't concentrate at work. I've consulted a doctor and he has prescribed some medicine and some time away from the stress of our relationship. Again, I am not blaming you, but I need some time to get my feet back under me and try to sort things out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Of course, this hurts. I remember the good times and the love we shared together. Last night I cried for an hour as I thumbed through our photo album and relived our vacation to Hawaii and our trip to Boston. So I closed the book and turned on the television. I ran across Casa Blanca--our favorite movie. I quickly changed the channel to a baseball game, which happened to be New York against Miami (the Yankees were always our team). I tried eating, but the only thing in the refrigerator was leftover pizza--with ham and mushrooms (which was our favorite, too). I hope you can see that this decision is not easy for me and I don't make it casually.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know you love me, too. It's just so hard to admit that we are so combustible when we are together. Let's both take some time to sift through all the issues and see if we think there is anything of our relationship left to salvage. My intention is not to discard it. My hope is that we can communicate in writing for a time, then get together and talk it out. If we find that we need to go separate ways, I'm sure we can have that conversation honestly and amicably. Or if we find that we want to give it another try, we can discuss the ground rules and maybe seek some professional help. But I can't make either of these decisions today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please believe that it hurts me to leave you but I am trying my best in a terribly difficult situation. When you have digested all of this, please write.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I miss you already.|Writing this letter makes me very sad. I don't want to hurt you, but I can't go on like this anymore. We need to end this relationship. Maybe we could try again in the future to make it work, but I can't try anymore right now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Trying to improve this relationship is all I've focused on lately, and it has negatively impacted other areas of my life: my job, my friends, and my family. I have been stressed out and on edge with everyone around me. I don't like who I am right now. I need to focus on getting back to where I feel happy and at peace with myself and my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Things have really worsened over the past few months. It seems like we don't talk at all anymore. I don't think we trust each other enough to even try to talk. We rarely spend any time together and when we do, it feels awkward and uncomfortable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We've both done regrettable things to this relationship and to each other. It's time we admit to ourselves and to each other that it's going to be a lot healthier for both of us to just to separate. It hurts me to tell you this because I still care about you very deeply. We've had some great times together and I hate to leave those behind, but I think we'll be better off apart. I will always care about you, and I will always remember the early days of our life together with fondness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let's wait a couple of months and then reevaluate how we feel. Maybe we can try to make our relationship work again, or maybe we'll discover by then that our lives have moved in separate directions and we can only be friends.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
791|Love||Tell me what I did wrong. (I know I can make it up to you.)|"I'm writing to you because you hung up on me the last time I called you. I'm not sure what I've done to upset you, but whatever it was, I'm sorry. From what other people have told me, I know I can be outspoken and sound offensive at times. I think part of the problem is that you and I were brought up in different cultures and at opposite ends of the country. What people from my corner of the world regard as honest and straightforward can be considered rude and abrasive here. It might help, though, if you would consider my intentions. I wouldn't deliberately do anything to hurt you because I'm falling in love with you. I knew that was true when I felt so wounded when you wouldn't talk to me. So please don't take offense where there was no offense intended.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although my intentions are good, it looks like I need someone with finer sensibilities to point out my blunders and teach me how to behave here. If you would be willing to take on this great challenge, we might have to spend long evenings together for me to really get the picture. Would you mind? I think that kind of arrangement would have a lot of benefits, and we could start going out together again, too. For openers, I've gotten prime tickets for ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in two weeks, and you know they're not easy to get. We need to make up before then so we can go see it together and find out why it's still so popular.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We hit it off so well when we first went out a month ago, I know we can get over this bump in the road. I'll stop by tomorrow evening around 7 p.m. to see if we can talk about it face-to-face. Afterward, if you would just let me put my arms around you, I know I can make you feel better. Just give me the chance."|How are things going? I haven't seen much of you lately. I'm not sure, but it seems like you're upset with me. You're not exactly out-and-out avoiding me, but every time I suggest doing something these days, you have some reason not to. And you haven't called for a few days. You could just be really busy, I guess, or maybe you have a lot on your mind with work or something else?<br><br><br><br><br><br>If I've done something to offend you or hurt you, I'm sorry--really. Jan told me yesterday that you had mentioned to her I had a phone conversation with Dave the other day. I don't know if my talking to him might have upset you, but I hope not. I know we haven't known each other for very long, but ever since Jan introduced us, I've thoroughly enjoyed spending time together and getting to know you. The last month and a half has been a lot of fun because I never know what to expect when I'm with you. You have a real love for life, and I truly admire your optimism and your positive attitude. You're such a good person, so your friendship means a great deal to me. Please know that I would never do anything to intentionally cause you pain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Could we get together and talk? I'd really like to know what's on your mind these days. Maybe we could go for a walk along the beach on Saturday (I can pack a picnic lunch), or we could go to Taquito's Friday night (my treat) and maybe catch a movie afterwards. I know how you love Mexican food.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What do you say? I'll call on Thursday to see how things are going and see if we can get together one of those days.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Take care.|When you walked away from me last night, I stood in the darkness for a while wondering what I had done to upset you. I know we've had our differences in the past, but we've always been able to talk them out. Usually, I have said something that you have misunderstood--maybe I'm too blunt and opinionated. If so, I truly apologize.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have replayed our conversation over and over in my head to try to identify the subject or phrase or action that went awry. Whatever it was, I'm sorry. My intention is never to offend you. I'm falling for you--I think you know that--but I'm also getting to know you. Please be patient with me as I discover the sensitive subjects and learn how to communicate on a level that does not cause offense.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please accept the flowers that I have sent along with this note. If you count them, you will see that there are 14, one for each week that we have known each other. Let's not throw that away over my blunder. Would you see me again? Would you explain to me what I have done or am doing wrong? Will you teach me how to do better? Could we pick up the pieces and start over? I promise to do better. I was hoping that you would agree to go with me to Marie's Restaurant (our first date) and then to Oklahoma! With the hope that you would say yes, I have made reservations and purchased tickets for this Saturday night.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we can work through this. Please give me another chance. We have had such a good relationship. Let's hold onto it. I'll call you tomorrow evening. Please say you'll go out with me so we can talk face-to-face. I want to make it right. I want to take you in my arms and feel your forgiveness. If you will give me this chance, I promise to do better.|I can tell that you're upset with me. You haven't called me in three days, and when I've tried to call you, you've had little to say and want to hang up quickly. I've thought about it and I can't figure out what I did to turn you against me. Did I do or say something wrong at the party last weekend? That's the last time I saw you. When we said goodbye, you didn't seem upset, but maybe I was just too tired to notice.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If I did do something, I'm really sorry. I can honestly say that I didn't mean to hurt you or offend you in any way. I love you. I hate it when you're unhappy with me. Could we please meet so you can tell me if I did something that bothered you? If it's not me and something else is bothering you that you haven't told me about, maybe we could have dinner and talk. I want to get everything out in the open and come to some kind of an understanding. If you're interested, we could go to a hockey game afterwards and just have some fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please think about it.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
792|Love||That was a stupid thing I said/did. (But I don't usually behave this way.)|"I know there is no one to blame but myself for what happened yesterday. There's an old saying, ""Open mouth, insert foot,"" that describes my behavior perfectly. I should know by now that you take most things seriously, but this relationship is still new to me and I'm used to being around guys who say whatever comes into their heads. That's no excuse, though, and I need to think before I speak, especially considering the consequences. Usually, I see a loving sparkle in those beautiful brown eyes, but yesterday all I saw was pain and disillusionment. Please, Megan, forget what I said; let's not break up over one stupid blunder.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've relived that moment over and over without my hurtful remarks, imagining our conversation continuing smoothly and ending with you in my arms. My imaginings didn't change anything, however, so all I can do is say I love you, Sweetheart, and I'm sorry I caused you pain. Usually, I behave better and act like a gentleman, so our conversations end with no problems. My only defense is that it's uncommon for me to be so inconsiderate, and I hope my guilty plea will encourage my beautiful judge to be lenient in sentencing. Could you let me off with, say, a two-week probation and early release for good behavior? I'm hoping you can, because you've always impressed me with what a kind person you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember one Saturday night we had planned to go out and then you called to cancel at the last minute. You said your sister was sick and she needed you to help her with the baby because her husband was out of town. At the time, I was really annoyed, but afterwards I thought it was a nice thing for you to do. It shouldn't have surprised me that you're loyal to your family, and I really shouldn't have expected you to override your sense of responsibility to go out to dinner and a movie with me--we can plan that anytime. Anyway, maybe someday I'll be on the receiving end of your loyalty and concern and you'll take care of me!<br><br><br><br><br><br>You told me once that you really like yellow roses. Check outside your door tomorrow evening and you'll find a bouquet filled with as many buds as the number of hugs and kisses I want to give you the next time we meet. Please tell me we can start over!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Why don't we have dinner at the Olive Garden like we did on our first date and try to put this behind us? I've heard that making up can be a very heart-warming experience!"|"I wasn't on my best behavior with your family yesterday, and I don't blame you for being upset. I'm sorry for the way I acted. I guess I'm just not used to sharing you with your family; it's a new experience for me because I'm used to having you all to myself. That doesn't make it all right, of course, but I hope that maybe it will help you understand why I behaved the way I did last night. In any case, I'm sorry for the pain that I caused your family, especially when I wanted to make a good first impression. I'm sorry most of all for hurting you. I didn't mean it, really.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you know that I don't normally act that way. Can you forgive me? I know I will have to share you on occasion, and I'm fine with that, just please be patient with me while I get used to doing so. I love you so much and having you in my life is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Being in this relationship has made me so happy. Like that song from Disney's Aladdin says, ""I'm in a whole new world with you.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>Do you remember that Saturday a few months ago when we volunteered at the children's shelter? We had such a great time serving lunch and then playing games with the kids. Watching you that day really made my love for you grow so much more. We hadn't really been seeing each other for very long at that point, but I saw into your heart that day. I knew then what a kind, gentle, loving person you are. I look up to you for your goodness and I hope that, despite my faults, you can learn to love me too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Will you let me take you out to dinner on Friday night? We can go to your favorite restaurant, and I'll make brownies a la mode for dessert. Then we could curl up on the couch and watch a movie, and from there...well, what do you say? Please say ""Yes""! I love you. I'll call tomorrow to see how you are doing."|"""I'm sorry"" doesn't begin to express my regret for acting badly. What I did was wholly inappropriate. I think I have exhausted the choices in the thesaurus, calling myself every name in the book (""stupid"" and ""jerk"" stand out above the rest). I've tried to think what I could have done to have messed up even more, but I can't think of anything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The bottom line is I know I hurt you. That causes me the most remorse. You didn't deserve any of my actions. I wish I had a good excuse. I do not. I can only say in retrospect that this is not characteristic of me. Although I have made many mistakes, I have rarely done anything this hurtful before. I only hope that it is forgivable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Can you find it within yourself to forgive me? Please, let's not break up over this. You can't imagine how my behavior and your reaction have haunted me. I replay it over and over in my head, wishing I could freeze the moment, erase it, and start all over. I realize how something so hurtful can damage or end a relationship--one careless moment and all that we had worked for gone up in smoke. Please don't let this happen. If you'll give me a chance, I know I can set this right.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you, and I can't bear the thought of losing you. I've never experienced a relationship like ours. It makes me feel complete; it makes me want to be better (although I still have a long way to go). I value your counsel--you always know just what to say. I see your smile and clouds disappear and the sun shines through. I look forward to midnight walks, gazing at stars, locating the North Star and pondering the universe with you. I love the way you bond with little children and cry during romantic movies. I treasure the little encouraging ""post-it"" notes you sneak in and leave on the refrigerator door. I remember one that said, ""Big smile. You will get that promotion."" That gave me the courage to face the interview and win the job.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know you love mint chocolates. The box that accompanies this letter might be a poor peace offering, but I hope you will accept it with my plea for forgiveness. I hope you'll allow me to do better on Saturday night. With the hope that you'll give me another chance, I have made reservations at Marie's Restaurant. We've made a lot of wonderful memories there. It was the best place I could think of to try and make amends. Will you please give me that opportunity? I'll call you Thursday night. Please say you'll go."|I'm sorry we fought last night. It was my fault. I take full responsibility. I'd had a bad day and ended up taking it out on you. Sometimes I get so worked up and then I say things that I don't really mean. I end up opening my mouth without thinking, and that's never a good thing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm normally a very calm and rational person. You know that what I did was unusual for me. Of course, that doesn't make it right, but at least it doesn't normally happen. I hope you can forgive me. I love you. I love us. I love the way we work together and enjoy each other's company.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember how, early in our relationship, your sister did something really stupid. I can't even remember what it was, but you were very upset about it. I remember how she called you to talk about it and apologize and how you expressed your forgiveness. I loved you all the more at that moment because I recognized what a kind and forgiving man you are. I hope you can be that forgiving with me when I occasionally get unreasonable and say things that I don't mean.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was able to get tickets to that hockey game you wanted to see on Saturday night. Let's go have fun and forget that this ever happened. I'm hoping I can pick you up at 5.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
793|Love||Too many things have come between us. (Let's go back to the way we were.)|"This morning, you had already left for work and I began to think about the way things were when we first got married and decided to jot down my thoughts while my head was still clear. We were so much in love, then, we couldn't wait to get home after work and tell each other everything that happened that day. I remember how we were both so interested in all the little details of our workday stories and how we would laugh over the smallest thing. The simplest meal was a feast to us and we needed very little to make us happy. We usually spent our evenings at home chitchatting, cuddling, and making love. Afterwards, we would just fall asleep in each other's arms. Back then we understood what the Hollies meant when they sang, ""Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you."" When I think about us now, it doesn't seem possible that our love could have changed so much in a few years.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The details of my workday aren't so interesting to you anymore and, I confess, I'm not too interested now when someone at your office gives notice or is starting a new romance. More often than not, you're too tired to cook a decent meal after work (not that I blame you) and you know I was never very handy in the kitchen. Unfortunately, boxed macaroni and cheese has lost its appeal for both of us. To make things worse, our schedules aren't in sync anymore and often we have to eat alone. It's obvious that the magic is going out of our love, too, because lately you just turn away when I get into bed. I remember when our love life could have rivaled the 4th of July fireworks, but even that has changed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know that one thing hasn't changed. I still love you and I always will; I hope you still love me too. That's really all we need to begin to turn things around and get back to the way we were. Let's look at everything that has come between us and decide what we should keep and what we should get rid of.<br><br><br><br><br><br>First of all, we are both working too many hours. I know you think so, too, because not long ago you mentioned that you had the option to work four days a week instead of five. I really didn't listen then, but perhaps you could still take the shorter schedule if you wanted to. I could stop working overtime, as well. Wouldn't it be great if we could get back to having dinner together again? I could help by trying my hand as chef and learning to cook a few meals a la Martin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we were hoping to put a down payment on a house soon, but what good is a house if the price we pay is a broken marriage? Owning a home can still be a major goal for us, but we could slow down a little in our pursuit of it. If our work schedules weren't so demanding, we could spend more time with each other--the way we did in the beginning when our love was the most important thing in the world.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We could find other ways to simplify our lives, too. For example, I don't need to be on the computer so long in the evening or be glued to the sports channel, either. If I took more notice of the beautiful woman I married, she probably wouldn't be talking to her friends on her cell phone so much, or going out with them so often, either. We've let other important things slip through the cracks, as well. We need to reinstate our weekly date night and start taking those long walks in the cool of the evening that we used to enjoy so much. We need to get to know each other again, Lucy, and we need to start spending quality time with each other to do that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As a first step, I propose we mark the beginning of the new ""old"" us by getting away this holiday weekend and leaving all the distractions behind--including the computer, the TV, and both cell phones. I've made reservations at that little resort in the mountains where we honeymooned a few years ago. It will be beautiful this time of year, as well as peaceful and quiet. We can relax and talk and have the time and energy to make all the love we're in the mood for.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let's pack our bags and load the car with plenty of relaxing CDs, including your favorite Josh Grogan album and my Harnoy cello sonatas. Please come with me so we can rediscover the magic that brought us together in the first place. I want to remember what it was like when all I needed was the air that I breathed and to love you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I look forward to seeing you tonight."|"I was just thinking about the ""good old days,"" back when we were students in grad school. Back then we had no time, no money, no possessions to speak of, and yet those were the happiest days I've ever known. Though we had to steal moments between work and classes and studying, we made time back then for us. Do you remember? We spent every second together that we could. Even if it was a few minutes in the library, a quick meal at the cafeteria, or (on rare occasion!) an actual evening together, we made the most of what we had.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We were so close back then. We used to share everything with each other--our successes, our failures, our fears, our dreams; we told each other everything. We had such big plans back then, do you remember? After we were done with school we were going to ""settle down"" and raise the perfect ""2.3"" kids, complete with the family dog and the white picket fence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Well, things haven't exactly worked out the way we thought. Our one-bedroom condo isn't exactly the home we dreamed of in suburbia, and everything else seems to have been put on hold, as well. No dogs, no kids, and definitely no settling down. We're just as busy now as we ever were, and we're definitely not giving very much time to each other. Between all the charity organizations and various committees meetings that I attend, and with your vigorous climbing of the never-ending corporate ladder with its 18-hour workdays, we barely see each other anymore. As I once heard someone say, it seems like ""You do your thing, and I do mine, and sometimes we meet in the bedroom.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't want things to continue this way. What has happened to us? We've let life come between us, I think. But I hope--I believe--that we can turn things around. I love you; you're still the most important thing in my life, and I'm sorry that I haven't always acted as if you were. So, I'm going to put us first again, because we're worth it. I'm going to stop giving so much time to my committees and clubs, and I'm going to be home a lot more in the evenings. With the hope that, if I'm home, it will entice you to come home, as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Just think. We could start taking our long walks in the evenings again, and go star-gazing sometimes (I know how much you said you missed doing that), and just have quiet dinners at home. We can start going out again to the theater and the ballet, and we could play tennis together on the weekends and go for Sunday drives like we used to. Picnic lunches up the canyon, bike rides through the city--we used to have so much fun together. With a little effort and planning, we can start doing all those things again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Why don't we begin to rekindle the romance in our relationship? Maybe we could start by going back to that quiet little inn up the canyon that you took me to a couple of summers ago. Remember what a great time we had there? We could take a long weekend and go canoeing and hiking again and, most importantly, just spend some time together, away from e-mail and cell phones and pagers. What do you say?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Hope you get home soon."|"Maybe you've sensed that I've been a little distant lately. I guess I've felt a certain sadness--maybe it's regret--when I think back on our relationship. When did it start to slip away from us? I've tried, but I can't recall a specific moment. Perhaps it's been a lot of little moments.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We used to play Frisbee baseball after work. Do you remember? Laughing was easy then. We couldn't wait to see each other--kissing and hugging were synonymous with greeting. We had lots to say--all the details of our day, secrets, and amusing gossip. We would pass each other love notes in our lunch sacks. Now, we struggle to be civil with each other; intimacy is on a schedule like taking out the trash; we don't hug; the notes to each other are reminders to pick up milk and cereal at the grocery store.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The hardest part for me is knowing that I still love you. I don't know how to reverse the process, but I believe we can do it. Somehow, we must make our relationship the priority, not just a priority. As I've spent the last few days pondering ""us,"" I have come to the conclusion that I want to fight back and make things better. I know we can't turn the clock back, but we can start at this point and get back to the way we were. It's time for spring cleaning, and I'm ready to begin throwing out the garbage. For example, our careers have become our lives--we bring the office home with us. I think we don't realize how much work dominates our conversations. And what happened to our weekend dates? We went out more when we were broke than we do now. Is it possible that we have stopped enjoying each other's company? We used to fix up the house together, cook together, take walks together--we used to discuss political viewpoints and read biographies together. When did it all stop?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we can save this relationship if we just put forth an effort to get back to these wonderful things we shared. It wouldn't be so hard, would it? I mean, it's not as though we have to learn any new skill; we just need to start doing what we used to do. We just have to try. I don't want to lose you, but I see red flags everywhere. We can't be so blind as to ignore the fact that relationships cannot endure this kind of neglect and still remain intact. Could we start trying to turn back the clock now?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let's celebrate our new beginning by getting away this weekend. We have always loved the mountains. I have reserved a cabin by the lake. We'll agree not to take our work with us or make any mention of it. I'm bringing our photo album and the camera. I want to hold you in my arms and recall all the wonderful memories we've made over the years. I want to take pictures of you and this beautiful trip so that we can make new memories.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We once knew how to love each other. We just need to remember what it was like. I know it will all come back to us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I look forward to seeing you tonight."|Do you remember how things used to be? We couldn't say hello or goodbye without a kiss. Sometimes we'd grab our coats and hats and take long walks around the city, holding hands and talking about almost everything. We'd jump in the car late Friday night and just drive up north to find some romantic bed and breakfast where we could spend the weekend--far away from our jobs, our families, and our real lives. All we wanted was to be together. We loved those weekend trips and we always came back rejuvenated and so much in love.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Things have changed since then. I didn't want them to and I don't think you wanted them to either. It started with small things. You'd come home from work and I'd be busy making dinner and forget to kiss you hello. At some point we decided that it was too cold to take long walks around the city and that it would be better just to stay home, but it seems all we talk about now is the weather and what needs to be done. And it's been almost a year since our last weekend trip. What happened?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you so much and I want those days back. I want to talk and share everything with you again. I know that your job has gotten a lot busier and that promotion you received came with increased responsibility. Our weekend trips might not be as spontaneous as before, but we could plan a week or two in advance. We could bundle up a little and plan a walk on a night when you will be getting home fairly early. Or maybe we could go to the mall and hold hands while we talk and window shop. That would keep the cold out of the equation. We could start new traditions, too. Perhaps I could greet you one night with a bubble bath and join you and wash your back.<br><br><br><br><br><br>.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What I'm trying to say is that I love you. I want this relationship to work; I don't want it to fizzle and die. I'm willing to fight to get it back so it will at least resemble the way it was before, before we let jobs and routines get in the way of remembering why we loved to be together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've got a surprise for you. Remember our favorite bed and breakfast? The one that had the enormous fireplace and the beautiful canopy bed? I've made reservations for next weekend. That gives us both time to settle other responsibilities so we can get away and start to reignite the passion and love that we are losing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
794|Love||I want to spend the rest of my life with you. (My love is real and so is my commitment!)|"It seems hard to believe, but we've been together for almost six months now. That's not very long in the grand scheme of things, but it's long enough for me to know how much I love you. I remember (but only vaguely now!) how my life was before I met you and I never want to go back to that dreary existence again. That was when I had nothing much to look forward to except a pizza delivery and a rented movie on Saturday night, nothing much to get up for in the morning except a day at work. Having had my heart broken twice already, I was becoming something of a hermit; sure I never wanted to get involved with anyone again. I was to the point where I believed that the ""happily ever after"" kind of love was only found in fiction and in fairy tales--but then I met you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank goodness the substitute mailman (or is it ""letter carrier"" now?) got our apartment numbers mixed up and I got a chance to play Mr. Speedy Delivery. The mutual attraction we felt for each other that day has changed my life forever. It was almost too much to hope for (because I have such strong opinions about everything), but we even have the same views on the war and the economy. We're never at a loss for words or things to talk about--that is, when our lips are free to speak! Now I believe in love again, because I believe in you. And I function at warp speed now because--it thrills me to say it--you actually believe in me!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Leah, you've brought me so much happiness and joy that I can scarcely contain it all. I'm sure beams of light radiate from me wherever I go. I noticed a few raised eyebrows at work when I started coming in bright and early (on time, every time!), smiling and energized, humming some love song I heard on the radio while driving in. A couple of the guys wanted to know what's up with me, but they don't understand I am filled with secrets that cannot be shared or even expressed in words. So I just told them that I'm seeing someone and it's the real thing this time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It's very strange because, even when we're apart, I feel that I'm still with you. I remember what it's like to hold you, to kiss you, to make love to you, as those delicious sensations never really leave me. We respond to each other so naturally and completely I believe the gods must have created us to complete each other's existence. Ours is a union that reaches beyond the mere physical into mystical planes that take my breath away. You are part of my very being now and I could never be complete or whole without you. Tell me I will never again have to return to that mundane existence I knew before I met you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>This morning I woke at dawn, still wrapped in the memory of last night, repeating over and over that line from that old Hollies' song: ""Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you."" I know what that means now because I know how that feels now. Leah, tell me we can always be together! Tell me all we need is one apartment key!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you."|"Hello, Love!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Do you remember the first day that we met? I was rushing to calculus, and I dropped my calculator. When I got to class and realized that it was gone, I was devastated. Though I had written my name and number on the inside, I didn't really think anyone would return it. When you called later that day, I was pleasantly surprised. That was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, and of so much more. That same honesty, that same candid nature that I felt in you from the very beginning has made getting to know you the best thing that has ever happened to me. At that time, I was at a point in my life where my faith in humanity was pretty low. You helped me to see the goodness that can still be found in people, and I will be forever grateful for your influence in my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You have such a great attitude, Jenn--your world is full of rainbows and sunbursts. You're gentle and kind. I love the awe and reverence that you feel for nature--like it's a part of you, and you're a part of it. You have such an appreciation for little things that most people wouldn't even notice--butterfly wings and ladybug spots, the scent of myriad wildflowers, the morning dew on tiny blades of mountain grass.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You're so smart--even if you don't like calculus. The world is an infinite puzzle that you delight in trying to solve. I've never met anyone that I could talk to so easily, about anything and everything. I trust you with things I've never shared with another soul, and I know that you keep them close to your heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Before I met you, I couldn't imagine living my life with just one person. Now, I can't imagine my life without you--the idea of one day without you is painful to think about! Before I knew you, ""forever"" was something I had heard about, but something I couldn't fathom. Now I know that we're supposed to be together, and no matter where I am, as long as I'm with you, that's where I want to be. You are my life, my heart, my soul. Because of you in my world, in my arms, I have everything, and I can't imagine what I'd do without you."" I promise you that I will spend the rest of my life devoted to making you happy, committed to the eternal joy we will find together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you and I need you. You complete me. You're a part of every fiber of my being, and you're constantly on my mind. You must be exhausted, always running through my thoughts by day and in my dreams by night."|"I've just been sitting here recalling what my life was like before I met you. Life! That's a joke. Eight months ago life meant going through the motions, monotonous movements, no joy, no sadness, no ups, and no downs--just one long stream of tedium. Then Bill invited me to a party (my stomach turns over when I remember how I almost said no!). And there you were--beautiful, happy, intelligent and incredible. Suddenly, I came alive--and I've been alive ever since.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It happened that very first night--I fell in love with you. How do I know? Because the feeling never left me and it has grown ever since. I think it always will. The lights went on. Instantly, life was exciting; colors seemed brighter; songs crisper; tastes more enjoyable. I ceased walking and began leaping. I realized that there is a whole wonderful world ready to explore--with the right person.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With you, I am at ease. I don't have to try so hard to talk about movies or music or politics or sports--or our favorite subjects: horseback riding and chess (who would have thought I could find someone with those interests in common?). I love being with you when we split a caramel sundae, stroll the park hand-in-hand without having to force a conversation, and cuddle up in front of the TV. Simple pleasures. I'm content and happy when I am with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you. From the depths of my heart, I love you to an extent that I never thought possible, and I know I always will. I cannot imagine life without you now. I want my life to be your life. I want to spend every minute of every day with you. I want to experience all that life has to offer--the good and the bad--with you at my side. I want to grow up and grow old with you. I want to hold you in my arms and never let you go. I want to feel the warmth of your kiss and whisper words of love into your ear. You are all that is good and beautiful; you satisfy all the longing that was in me--body and soul. Tell me I will never again be relegated to a colorless, mundane world.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I sit here in the quiet of my room trying to compose this letter and express feelings that poets have struggled to say, I am reminded of lyrics that might say it best: ""Who knows how long I've loved you? You know I love you still. Will I wait a lonely lifetime? If you promise to, I will.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>My sweetie, please don't make me wait a lonely lifetime. If you promise to, I will.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you."|"My Sweet Emily,<br><br><br><br><br><br>Remember that day I went to the supermarket to buy pickles? But pickles were nowhere to be found. So I asked this really cute cashier if she knew where the pickles might be hiding, and she began to lead the way. She was intriguing: open and yet, somehow, mysterious. Somewhere between the frozen foods and the baby kosher dills, I fell in love. A year has passed since you led me through the grocery aisles, and I haven't given pickles a second thought since then.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My whole world has changed for the better now that you love me. When I think of you, I can't help smiling from ear to ear. (What must people be thinking when they look at me?) Because of your example, I find that I am much kinder to people. I'm happy. I'm so full of love that it is reflected in everything I do. I treat my co-workers with more thoughtfulness. I've even become a considerate driver!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love the time we spend together. Each Sunday afternoon, I look forward to our one-on-one basketball game in the driveway--even though you win every time! I never feel more at peace than when we simply hold hands, watch the sunset, and whisper how we feel. I love listening to your voice.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want you to know you can always depend upon my love. It is alive and true, and grows stronger each day. I promise I will always love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We are perfect for each other: our zest for life, our stubborn determination, and our looking at the world with a cockeyed sense of humor. Aren't we glad that we both enjoy onion rings with mustard, the front-row in roller-coasters, and ""short"" Monopoly? Then, of course, there are my peanut butter and banana sandwiches--I think you're actually starting to develop a taste for them now! Most importantly, we share love. We're good for each other in so many ways, and we always find ways to lift and encourage each other.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Cole Porter couldn't have said it any better...<br><br><br><br><br><br>You're the Nile! You're the Tow'r of Pisa,<br><br><br><br><br><br>You're the smile of the Mona Lisa!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop!<br><br><br><br><br><br>But if baby I'm the bottom,<br><br><br><br><br><br>You're the top!"|From the first moment that I saw you standing in the comedy aisle at Blockbuster, I knew that we would be together. I don't know how; I don't usually believe in that sort of thing, but somehow I knew. Maybe it was the fact that you were holding an Adam Sandler DVD in your hand (I love his movies!). Maybe it was the fact that you were wearing shorts in December. Maybe it was the way you looked at me as I walked by. I'll probably never know exactly what caused it, but I just knew that you were the one.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ever since that day, I have been happy. I never imagined that someone could be this happy all the time and it's all because of you. You are the reason that I find myself singing those old '80s love songs in the shower. You are the reason that I sometimes get the urge to run down the street laughing. And you are the reason that I smile so often now. All I have to do is picture your face and think of our last meeting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I enjoy so many of the things that we do together. I love talking with you, discussing current events, or just our normal days. I love taking walks with you in the mountains, having picnics, and enjoying the beauty around us. But simply watching TV together makes me content. I don't need anything except to be with you. I love you. That will never change. I am committed to us. I am committed to our future together.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I truly believe that we were meant to be together. I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||
795|Love||We need to see a marriage counselor. (It's time we let someone come between us!)|Because we parted last night in anger, I decided to write you a letter rather than call. We both needed to cool off a little and think about what's happening to us. I don't really know when our arguments first started (do you?), but we can't seem to resolve them peacefully anymore. Although our passionate natures helped to bring us together in the first place, they have also meant that both of us have hair triggers on our tempers. We don't seem to be able to sit down and discuss a problem like two rational people anymore. With our volatile personalities, we just get angry and start fighting, then make up later when the memory fades and we start to miss each other. This behavior is beginning to form a recurrent pattern that we can't seem to break.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We've been together for almost five years now, so we've invested a few years of our lives into this relationship already and should think twice before we throw it away. When it is good, it is very, very good, but those times are getting further and further apart. Now we need to decide if there's enough love here to hold on to, or if this relationship has just run its course and we should give it up. I know I still love you, Christy. If you love me too, then together we could try to find the road back to the way we were. I'm just afraid we need someone else to help us do that now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The worse things get, the more I think we need to find someone who'll show us how to settle our arguments peacefully. Maybe this person could even help us figure out why we're arguing in the first place. It may take a little work, but it would be worth it if we could start to build new memories as great as the old ones. I'll call you Sunday evening to see how you feel about going to a counselor with me. Sweetheart, let's hold on to what we've got and not let it slip away!|I don't know exactly what you're thinking these days, but I'm pretty sure that you are as aware as I am that things have been a little rocky between us lately. Well, a lot rocky, really. We've always had our differences--remember how we always teased that opposites attract and that fighting was worth it because making up was so much fun? Over the last few months, though, it seems that we've been fighting all the time and we don't see eye-to-eye on anything anymore. We've both become quite independent over the last couple of years as our careers have started to take shape, and we're not nearly as easygoing as we used to be.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the past we could always compromise and work together through our challenges, but things just aren't getting better this time. I keep thinking that these little difficulties will vanish, but they don't. We make resolutions to be better partners, yet nothing changes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't want to give up on us. I love you--it seems like I've loved you forever now. I don't want to let go of this relationship, and I don't want to lose you. We've been so close in the past, had so many good times, and we've both grown a great deal. Could we really let all of that come to an end?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't know what more we can do. These days we seem to be talking in circles, unable (or unwilling?) to listen to each other. Life's just not as simple as it used to be. I know that in the past I was hesitant to involve other people in our problems, but now I think that it might be wise to seek outside help if we want this relationship to last. Honey, are we ready to do that? I hope so.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have a friend who was going through some marital problems about a year ago. At that time she mentioned a counselor that she was seeing, and she spoke very highly of her. Will you call me by this weekend and tell me what you think about possibly seeing this guidance counselor if she's available? Hope to hear from you soon. I love you.|"I've done a lot of thinking since yesterday's argument. I finally decided to put pen to paper in an effort to express my feelings and concerns. Clearly, we are having some trouble in our marriage. We keep bumping up against issues that we can't seem to resolve. From the days of our courtship we knew that we had diverse personalities and that we saw things differently. Of course, that is one of the reasons why we fell in love--I remember that we used to laugh about opposites attracting and that we could never expect a dull moment. Now, looking back, I think that we underestimated the power of our differences. We can't seem to see a clear path to resolution.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Maybe it's time to admit that we need some help. The harsh words, the disagreements over money, the social-you/anti-social-me issue, the chipping away at each other's self-image--it's all got to stop. I'm exhausted, and I think you are, too. I think we both want and need some peace, but we don't know how to arrive. Like my father used to say: you can try to chop a tree down by whacking at the leaves, or you can take an axe to the trunk and go for the root. I want to chop down the tree. I want to get at the root of the problem and stop this senseless whacking at each other. I want to fight the core issue, not you. But I feel like I'm going into battle without any ammunition. I am willing to go to a counselor with you to get help for ""us"" right now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I think of the years we have spent together, the obstacles we've faced, the good times and the bad, I want to explore every option to save our marriage. There is just too much investment to throw it all away. It seems that neither of us has the magic answer to turn this around by ourselves, however. We need some outside help.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Outside of every consideration, let me state as plainly as possible that I still love you (although I have often struggled to say it). I want our relationship to work. This may be the fight of my life to repair our marriage, but I believe it is worth saving. I know (I think we both know) that there are skills that each of us needs to develop. Our ability to agree and disagree lovingly and civilly needs to improve. We need to remember what we enjoyed about each other when we were dating. We need to recall why we fell in love in the first place--sacrifice for each other a little more, learn to bite our tongues once in a while, concentrate on acting and not reacting. A lot of work, admittedly, but if we each gave a 100 percent and allowed each other some time to learn, I know we could find healing and renew our love. Isn't it worth a try?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember a golden moment, many years ago, when I took you by the hand, went to my knees, and begged you to be my wife. Now, I am begging you to remain my wife. Please, let's take this counseling step together and work out our problems."|We've both known that our relationship has been in trouble for awhile now. I don't know about you, but I haven't wanted to admit it. I've tried to ignore the problem and pretend that it didn't exist. I don't know about you, but I can't go on like this anymore. I accept responsibility for my part in our problems, and I think that you do too, but neither one of us knows how to fix it. We've both certainly tried, but it just hasn't worked out. I think that in order to save this marriage, we need to move in the right direction toward reconciliation. It has taken two of us to get ourselves into this mess, but I think it's going to take three of us to get us out. I think we need to see a marriage counselor.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I love you. I believe that this marriage is worth saving and can be saved. It may take a lot of work, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes, and I hope you are too. I'm not willing to just give up the past ten years without a fight. When I look back on the early days of our marriage, I remember how happy we were! We never ran out of things to say to each other and sometimes we used to talk all night! We wanted to spend all of our time together. I want us to be like that again. Now it seems that we'd rather be with our friends or at work than with each other. On the rare occasions we do have dinner together anymore, neither one of us has much to say nor is it enjoyable. It seems like there's more silence than conversation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm lonely. I miss the way we were. I want us to be us again. Please say that you'll come with me to talk to a counselor. I'll find the counselor and make the appointment. Just tell me when you'll be available.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
796|Love||We need to slow down. (I'm feeling a little crowded!)|I got your letter and wanted to write back to tell you how I feel before things go any further. Besides, I probably couldn't say what I need to in person looking into those big brown eyes of yours!<br><br><br><br><br><br>First of all, I want you to know I've been having a great time with you and I've really enjoyed every date we've been on. I'm a little worried, though, that we might be getting a little too serious too quickly. I know you wrote that you were losing interest in going out with anyone else but I still would like to see other guys now and then. I'm in my last semester, and I need to focus on my Linguistics M.A., and not get involved in a long-term relationship just yet. And you I think you better keep your mind on your statistics courses and your Computer Science degree. I'm learning how much brain power that requires, just with the one stats course I took and trying now to validate my thesis by running complicated statistical tests.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The semester before last I made the mistake of getting too deeply involved with someone and my grades started to slip. Remember, with a B.A. we could get an A, a C, or anything in between and still graduate, but with an M.A. we've got to make the high grades or we'll have to repeat the semester. They don't accept C's anymore where we are, so we need to stay focused. There'll be plenty of time for serious romance later on. And another thing, those goodnight kisses are getting a little too intense for me and I'm starting to worry we could get carried away and do something we'll both regret later.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think the best thing for both of us right now is to date each other less often and still be free to go out with other people if we want to. That way we can keep things under control emotionally as well as not lose sight of what our educational priorities should be at this point in our lives. Please, don't take this the wrong way. I think you're a great guy and I'm not suggesting I don't want to see you anymore, but just less often--maybe twice a month, okay?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've been having a lot of fun going out with you--I just can't afford to have that much fun right now! I need to be more serious about my education, and so do you. Speaking of which, I need to go hit the books because I've got a long day tomorrow outlining the statistics chapter of my thesis, as well as teaching my afternoon class. Why don't you call me in a couple of weeks and we'll plan on getting together again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope to see you soon (just not too soon).|I hope you know that I care a great deal about you, too. I will always remember the fun times that we have had together. But I'm worried that we're going too far, too fast. We really haven't known each other very long, and I'm just not ready to make too strong a commitment yet. We still have a lot to learn about each other; you might yet discover that my halo wobbles now and then!<br><br><br><br><br><br>We haven't really talked a whole lot about previous relationships, but I've learned from experience that it is best to take these things slowly. I've made mistakes, and I've been hurt badly in the past by people that I never should have let myself care about as much as I did. I don't know--maybe you have too? I don't want that to happen again. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I don't want to ruin that by letting our emotions (and our hormones!) rule our heads.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I still want to spend time with you, I still look forward to spending time with you, but I've got to take things more slowly (at least for a while). Why don't we try toning things down a little--maybe try only going out about once a week? Then we can have time to see other people if we want to, and we can allow our friendship to continue to develop without getting quickly in way over our heads.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you won't stop writing altogether. I love reading your letters! Take care of yourself.|Oh, how can I say this without you taking it the wrong way? We've been seeing a lot of each other lately, and you've been so sweet to me. Each time you look at me with those big, blue eyes, I want to melt. Please don't misunderstand--I've enjoyed the time we have spent together. You are funny, smart, and generous. But when I received your recent letter, I realized that our relationship is becoming too serious, too quickly for me. I need to date at a slower pace right now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You need to know that I have made a commitment to myself and to my parents that nothing would get in the way of my graduation. Until then, I want to enjoy dating several guys on a casual basis, but not get tied down to anyone yet. I've really had to adopt this mindset of no long-term relationships for the moment or I will never be able to complete my degree. Last year I failed in my resolve and entered into a serious relationship--only to have it and my grades crash. The readjustment process was too painful to repeat. I hope you can appreciate that. I'm just not ready; it's the wrong season of my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you'll respect my request that we see each other less often and feel free to enter into other relationships yourself. That will give our emotions time to settle down and me time to graduate. That said, I want to say that I think you're a great guy. Do I want to see you again? Yes, but just not quite so often--maybe twice a month--and without the expectation of immediate commitment. I've had a lot of fun with you. But I have to maintain tunnel vision until graduation, and so I close this letter now and make my way to the books. I'm really sorry if this hurts you. If you still want to see me, why don't you could call me in a couple of weeks and we could plan something. Until then, let's give it a breather.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for understanding.|Although I realize I cannot expect feelings of constant bliss, I am beginning to worry that we might be getting too serious, too quickly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Until we decide otherwise, let's not commit ourselves exclusively to this relationship. Instead, let's remain free to date others. Other aspects of our lives need our attention, too, so let's take some time to focus on our jobs and our studies.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm sure you will agree that we probably shouldn't try rushing our feelings. Let's make sure we are comfortable together first, and let's also take time to think about our relationship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Maybe we can see each other less often, at least until we know which direction to pursue.|I want you to know how much I appreciate our friendship and how much I enjoy spending time with you. I'm concerned, though, that we may be rushing into our relationship. After all, we're just getting to know each other, and I've learned from sad experience not to rush into anything too quickly. More than once I've jumped into deep waters and found that I couldn't swim. I don't want that to happen to either one of us. We're moving too fast right now, and I'm starting to feel pressured to commit to a level of trust and intimacy I'm not ready for. I want you to understand this, because I know you will respect my feelings. I'm thinking that you may be feeling the same way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am at a point in my life where I still want to explore different possibilities, including having the freedom to date other people. You need to understand that I'm just not ready for an exclusive relationship, but don't get me wrong--I want to keep seeing you. If we are really right for each other, then slowing down and dating others will make us even more aware of how compatible we are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've thought about this a lot, and I'm convinced that taking things slowly will benefit both of us. I need to focus on completing my nursing degree and I understand that you are working towards getting promoted into management. The way we are doing things now, though, my grades have started to suffer and, from what you've said, I don't think things aren't going so smoothly for you, either.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think we should slow down a little and see each other every couple of weeks for a while. Let's take our time to get to know each other better. Our relationship has so much potential, but I want to take things slow and easy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for understanding and being sensitive to my feelings.|I really like you, but we need to slow down. It feels like our relationship is moving so fast that I'm no longer in control and that's not a feeling I'm comfortable with. I've been in relationships before that have moved too fast and then crashed and burned. I don't want that to happen to us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As I said, I really do like you and I enjoy the time that we spend together, but I'm feeling a lot of stress. I'm torn because I want to see what happens to our relationship, but things are happening so fast that I'm starting to get anxious and worry about it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't want this to be the end; I'd like to keep seeing you, but I'm just not ready to commit myself only to you. I would love to see you once or twice a week, so we can continue to get to know each other and let things happen naturally, but I'm just not ready to get too serious right now. I hope that you can understand that and we can still see each other, but not quite as often.||||||||||||||||||||||||||
797|Love||We never really talk. (Tell me what you're thinking.)|"I'm writing this letter so that I can organize my thoughts as I go along and consider what I want to say to you. The fact is, I've been feeling a void inside me for a long time now, but I never really knew what was missing until today. I was driving home from work and heard an old song by Bryan Adams on the radio. The song was ""Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?"" and it began: To really love a woman, to understand her, you gotta know her deep inside, hear every thought, see every dream."" And then I realized what was bothering me--even though we live together, there's so much about me you don't know, and a lot I don't know about you, either. We don't know very much about each other because we never really talk.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm sure you remember when we first met how our attraction for each other was so strong that we were soon making the kind of love you read about in steamy romantic novels. Back then neither one of us found any need to do a lot of talking, I know. After a year, though, I've had a chance to come up for air and realize it's time we got intimate on another level--one that can only be reached through more serious conversations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>After work, we're both so tired we only talk about practical matters as we prepare dinner, watch a little TV, and then go to bed. I'm glad we can still satisfy each other with the way we make love, but we soon fall asleep lying there peacefully afterwards. Morning comes before long and most of our weekdays pass just as quickly the same way. On weekends you're off to some sports event or we're shopping or cleaning the apartment. Soon the week is gone and we've never had the time to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk about anything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish we could find time to go for a long walk once in a while or cuddle up on the couch together without the TV and just talk about whatever is on our minds. You don't need to tell me anything earth-shattering. I'd simply like to know what's going on with you these days. For example, I suspect there's some problem at work that's causing you tension lately, but you never talk to me about it. I can be a good listener if you would just give me the chance. As for me, I'd like to explain how my new supervisor is making my life difficult and why I'm thinking about turning in my resignation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We really don't know much about each other's backgrounds, either. I'd like to know what it was like for you to move from state to state every time the army transferred your father, or why it is you don't get along with your sister. I'd like to tell you how I felt when my parents got divorced when I was seven, or why I'd like to go back to Monterrey and see the California poppies and Crystal Beach again. If we could learn to share what's weighing on our minds, we could encourage the hopes and dreams--and lessen the fears and worries--we each experience separately now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When you find this letter, I will have already gone out to the park near the library. I'll be waiting for you on the bench under the horse chestnut tree in the southeast corner. It's the only chestnut there among all the oak and maple trees. When I was a little girl, I used to read books on that bench every Saturday. I've packed a picnic lunch and we can eat on the grass where there are no distractions. Come and join me and tell me how your day went (please turn your cell phone off).<br><br><br><br><br><br>With love and expectation!"|How are you doing, my love? Things are pretty good on this end of campus. I had a great time with you last night at the baseball game. I never would have guessed you were such an avid sports fan! You can holler with the best of them. You never cease to amaze me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know, I was thinking last night after I dropped you off that we've been seeing each other for almost six months now. Time really flies, doesn't it? I've really enjoyed spending time together and getting to know you. And yet, as I was looking back, I realized that there is still a lot I don't know about you. Rather, there is so much more that I would like to know about you. Obviously I know quite a bit about some things, though. I know about your job with the botany professor, for example, and about how your classes are going, and some of the things that are happening with you and your roommates.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We are always busy; we both have our classes and work. We always have plenty to talk about, but I don't think we ever really go much beyond the surface. It seems we have discussed anything and everything--and yet nothing. I'm curious--what are your real dreams and ambitions? What would you like to accomplish? What do you see yourself wanting to be in ten, twenty, or fifty years? What is your greatest goal in life?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Who knows, maybe you have wondered the same things about me. I was thinking that it would be great to get away on Saturday (leave school, work, friends, roommates, whatever) and just spend some uninterrupted time together. It's been a while since we've done that. We could go hiking up to Promissory Point, have a picnic lunch, and just talk about our plans and hopes for the future--and anything else that comes to mind or that you would like to discuss. I think it would be really good for us, and it would help us to get to know an aspect of each other that we really haven't explored before.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What do you say? I'll stop by after my calc class tomorrow afternoon to see if that will work.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't wait to see you.|This is different, isn't it--writing you a letter, I mean. I started jotting down notes and realized that I might be able to express my feelings better this way than in person. Which brings me to what has been bothering me: we don't seem to be able to communicate very well lately. I've been feeling empty inside. It has nothing to do with the way I feel about you--my love for you has never wavered. But I'm wishing we had more. There is so much that I wish we could say to each other--the little trivial things, deep things, personal things. We used to talk about everything. We were giddy and experiencing new love. Everything you said was a discovery for me. I wanted to know everything about you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It seems that the more we've been together, the more quiet we have become. Is it our busy schedules? Stress? Fatigue? Boredom? We arise early, barely have enough time for breakfast, give each other a quick kiss, and rush out the door. Only occasionally do we call each other during the day. At night we eat dinner and flop in front of the TV. You usually drift off and I read the paper. (When is the last time we both watched an entire movie together?) I'm afraid of becoming an old, tired couple that still lives together but has no excitement and no energy to try any longer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please say this is not happening to us! I'll tell you what I wish--I wish we could spend 10 minutes over breakfast planning something fun or unusual for the end of the day. I wish we could get a French cuisine recipe book and cook dinner together. I wish we could read the newspaper as a couple and discuss stories of interest. I wish we could take a walk and remember the dreams of our courtship. I'd like to hear about your day; I'd like to tell you about mine. I want to get out the photo albums that your mother sent us and have you tell me stories of your childhood. I want to dust off my yearbook and tell you silly stories about what happened to me during junior high. I want to share personal things with you again. That's what keeps love exciting and alive.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Could we try? It doesn't have to be forced or uncomfortable. What about tonight? My sister has a great recipe for crepes. I've located your photo album and my yearbook. I've hidden the remote control, and I've fluffed up the pillows on the couch. Let's learn to talk and laugh again. Let's gaze into each other's eyes and remember why we fell in love in the first place. Let's snuggle on the couch and see where it leads.|I had dinner with my sister last night. She was telling me all about her new boyfriend and, all of a sudden, it hit me with amazing force how little I know about you. We don't talk. We make small talk about our days and the weather, but we don't talk about our dreams, our feelings, or our past. I don't know why I didn't realize this before. At first I thought that we were just talking less than we used to, but now I think that we have never really talked. As I sit here thinking about it now, I can't think of one conversation we ever had that had any import to it at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We spend a lot of time together, but it doesn't involve a lot of talking. We go to movies, we ride our bikes, and we kayak. We do things where talking just isn't involved. And our lives are so busy that we don't have time to even sit down and talk on a daily basis. It's kind of sad.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I enjoy being with you, but our relationship is starting to seem a bit shallow. I'd like it to be a lot deeper. I'd like to learn more with you--about everything. I think that communication could really strengthen what we have and make it more secure. There are so many things that I want to know about you! What is your favorite candy bar? What are your favorite movies and favorite songs? What was your family like when you were growing up? What are your siblings like?<br><br><br><br><br><br>And I'd like for you to know more about me. I want to be able to tell you about my life: what happened before I met you, and what I hope for in the future. I think it will bring us closer together to talk about these things. What do you think? Let me make dinner Friday night. You can come over and, instead of watching a movie, we'll just talk. I'm looking forward to learning more about who you really are and sharing more about me.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
798|Love||We've come to a standstill. (Let's reconsider our goals.)|"I was shopping at Wal-Mart today and they were playing those old songs from the >80s over the PA like they usually do and, suddenly, the words of one of them hit me as if the singer were talking to me personally. I had been thinking about us at the time and now Glenn Frey was telling me I needed to do ""some soul searchin',"" which is what I really started to do. I thought about how we met, fell in love, and then got involved in this intimate relationship and how we've been together now for over three years. ""I love you"" is something we say to each other every day and I'll say it again. I love you and I can't really imagine my life without you in it. You've been the center of my hopes and dreams for a long time, but I want you to know that my most important hopes and dreams have not yet become a reality.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was a long haul, but you and I both managed to graduate in the past five years and find good jobs in our individual fields that pay reasonably well. As I remember, finishing our degrees and starting our careers were the two major obstacles that had originally kept us from planning our future together as a couple. But now you've reached all the short-term goals that were on your list and so have I. And the truth is, we haven't made any long-term goals for our relationship or even talked about our commitment to each other for a long time. So what's next? Do you know? Every time I bring up anything about ""us"" and our future together, you seem uncomfortable and change the subject. I'm beginning to wonder if we are actually drifting apart instead of growing closer together. Is that just my imagination?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ever since I was a little girl, I always believed the natural course of my life would eventually include all the trappings of a traditional American woman--a husband, a home, and children--but now my whole life seems to be spent in the typical 9-to-5 rat race. Don't get me wrong, it was a great accomplishment for me to get a degree and find a good job, but now I realize I'm not satisfied with that anymore. I also need to know what you want from me down the road: just a roommate who's a career person like you, a full-time homemaker and mother, or maybe just something in between? Before any more time goes by, we need to decide if we even still want the same things in life and if we both envision our future happiness built upon a relationship together or not.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At any rate, I can't go on much longer the way we are. Things have been getting increasingly more difficult for me in this relationship. I feel like I'm in a car with the motor stuck in neutral and I'm not moving forward any more. You've been out of town for a week now and I'm really missing you. But when you come back and read this we need to have a serious talk about our relationship and what our next step together should or shouldn't be. Just like the man was telling me in the song today, we need to ""take a look inside, no matter what we see."" We need to do ""some soul searchin', just you and me.""<br><br><br><br><br><br>The apartment was getting oppressive without you in it and so I've moved in with Susan until you get back. When you find this letter, call me and we can have a serious talk about our future."|I know that you said before that you needed more time, and I have tried to respect that. But we've been seeing each other (on occasion) for almost ten months now, and I'm just not sure where this relationship is going--if it's going anywhere anymore. When we first started going out, we seemed to have so much in common, and I thought you really cared about me. Was I wrong, or have your feelings changed somehow?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hate to think that you've been leading me along, but I'm concerned because you still aren't willing to make a strong commitment to our relationship. I've tried to express the feelings that I have for you, but you keep putting me off. I believed that we were heading in the same direction. But I am ready to plan my future--am I wrong to still hope that you will be a permanent part of it one day? You always talk about your family and how much they mean to you--don't you ever think these days about having a family of your own?<br><br><br><br><br><br>We need to talk. You must know how much I've come to care about you. I love you--there, I said it. Is there any hope that you might love me too? I don't think I can go on any longer like this. I need to know where you're coming from. If you don't think you can ever feel the same way for me that I do for you, I need to know. I love you, I want you, I need you--but I can't wait forever. Please say that we can get together soon and talk.|"I was at the mall today, and stopped to watch a young boy playing at a pinball machine. I observed him for a little while and he always kept the ball in play--back and forth, up and down. That's when it hit me. My relationship with you has been bouncing all over the game board, too, for over a year now. But it never really moves forward--the game just continues.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We've dated, we say ""I love you,"" but there is no movement toward commitment. We discuss philosophies on married life--everything from rearing kids to raising a garden--but the conversation never leads to an action. Is it all just words? Well, here are some words for you: I love you. I can't imagine life without you. I don't think I could ever find anyone like you. You carry all my hopes and dreams; you are in my every thought. I feel as if I have always known you; you were in my dreams before I ever met you. I am ready to take the next step in our relationship--the BIG one, the one that says, ""I'm yours forever. I'm willing to walk with you to the depths and the heights life has to offer. Whatever happens, I'll be there at your side, and we'll face it together. I'm ready. We've known each other long enough to know how we will react to life--we usually even know what the other one is thinking.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So where do we go from here? You know how I feel. But do you know how you feel? I think it's time we seriously thought about ""us"" and our future. It's time to put away our fears and misgivings. We've danced around the ""us"" subject for too long now. Whenever I've mentioned any long-term commitment, you've been quick to change the subject--or is it just my imagination?<br><br><br><br><br><br>My hope is that you'll approach ""us"" with the same determination that you showed when you fought for your degree and your first promotion. That is what I need from you right now--I need you to fight for ""us."" Otherwise, I'm afraid that we are stuck, or worse, drifting apart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At any rate, I can't be the pinball anymore. I love you, but I can't bounce around anymore. I hope you will read into this letter my sincere commitment to our relationship. After you have time to read and digest it, let's sit down and have a serious talk. Maybe you'll feel differently, but I hope not. After I drop this letter off, I'm going for a long walk to sort things out--I'm feeling a little anxious. You know my cell number. Please call me when you are ready to talk."|Is it just me, or has our relationship become stagnant after three months of being together? I'm not sure where we are heading, and I believe we need to take new steps in our relationship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm doing a lot of soul-searching and self-evaluation, and I want you to do the same. I'm not thrilled with our relationship the way it is. We have no clear direction, and I cannot continue like this any longer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I need to know how you feel about us, and where you would like to see us in the near future.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Could we get together on Friday evening, around 8 and talk?|"Both my mind and heart are heavy as I'm beginning to realize some things about our relationship. Today I left work early and drove to a quiet place to think--up in the mountains to our favorite grove of aspen trees. That's where I am now as I write you this letter and share my thoughts with you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As you know, we've been dating for nearly two years now, and we had been friends before that as long as I can remember. My feelings for you haven't changed. I still love you. But our relationship is like a ship on the ocean with no wind in its sails--motionless on the water with no direction. That is to say I don't think our relationship is progressing anymore.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We first agreed to take our relationship slowly and see where it led us. Then, over time, ""life"" began to happen to both of us: after business school I wanted to find a career job, and you focused on getting a promotion and paying off some debts. We both wanted to feel secure before we allowed our relationship to move to the next level of commitment. But we've both met our goals months ago, and our relationship is still stuck in neutral.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I feel empty inside. My job is not enough to satisfy me. There's so much more I want in life--marriage, a family and a home. When I think of this kind of life, I really can't picture it without you. We've spoken of marriage before, but only casually, as if the matter required no urgency. Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I think you're a dreamer, as well. I think you probably dream of a better life, and I'm hoping your dream includes me, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've come to a decision now. I can't go on living our ""status-quo"" relationship anymore. I want to move ahead, and it would make me so happy to move ahead with you--if that would make you happy, too. So I really need to know how you feel about ""us."" Over the next few days, could you take some time to think about your feelings and what your goals in life now are? Please call me when you're ready to tell me what you've decided. Let's take another drive to the grove of aspen trees, away from the noise of the city, and honestly discuss our future.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please call me soon."|We've been together now for almost a year. Overall, it's been a great year. You know I love you, but lately it seems as though things have come to a complete standstill. We're not moving forward anymore. I want you to be a part of my life, but I can't continue the way things are. I'm not happy because I'm unclear as to exactly what we're doing or where we're going.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The short term goals that we set have all been accomplished, and it's time to set some new goals for our relationship. I would like to see us spend more time together, talk more, share more, and take the relationship a step further. How do you feel? Do you want the same thing?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Can we talk about this? I'll call you.||||||||||||||||||||||||||
799|Love||You mean everything to me. (You're my better half; we make each other whole!)|The months and the years are slipping by and I tell you often enough that I love you, that my life would not be complete without you anymore. I don't know, though, if I've really told you how loving you has improved the quality of my life in so many ways. For one thing, I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten this last promotion without your encouragement. I knew I had the experience and the know-how, but I just wasn't bold enough to step forward when the position first became available. It was your faith in me and in my abilities that actually gave me the nerve to apply for it. Now that I have it, I use so much more of my education and experience, and my self-esteem has gotten a real shot in the arm, too--all thanks to you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Loving you also means I have the opportunity to be there for you when you need me. I remember when you wanted to make a proposal to your project committee and you needed to practice on an audience. I learned a lot from hearing your great ideas on improving efficiency and productivity in an advertising department. I was glad you thought that trying out your presentation on me helped improve your final draft. When your proposal was accepted and the changes you suggested became a reality, your success was as much a boost to my ego as it was to yours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wonder if you know how much I look forward to the simple things we share, like our talk fest over dinner at the end of a long workday. It's a great stress reliever to tell you all the day's events and listen to you analyze why this happened, or why that person behaved the way they did, and then speculate together on how tomorrow will line up. On the weekends, I enjoy relaxing with you and just watching a movie, critiquing every aspect of the production like professional movie critics, making judgments on everything from the casting choices to the quality of the screenplay.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can't even imagine my life now without all the things we enjoy together--our passionate lovemaking, luxurious bubble baths, and lazy sleep-ins on Sunday morning. Through the days and through the nights, thank you for always being there; I'll always be there for you. I want you to know how much I truly love and appreciate you, Sweetheart. You mean everything to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am forever yours.|I am so grateful that you are in my life. Your tender caring and gentle ways, your strength, and your love for life have influenced every part of who I am, even down to the colors that I like--remember how I used to hate red before you came along? You've encouraged me to do things that I may never have had the courage to try without you--things like scuba diving, rock climbing, even sky diving. You've also helped me to appreciate things that I had always taken slightly for granted to a greater extent--things like the importance of families and patriotism. You've also helped me gain an interest in preserving and enjoying the natural beauty around us.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for your support and for your love. Thank you for being so caring and so kind. You make me feel like a princess--you treat me like a woman longs to be treated. Thank you for the flowers on special occasions, for taking me dancing (even though you claim to have two left feet), for going on long walks with me, for opening doors for me and pulling out my chair. I know these are little things, and I know that some of them are things that many women don't appreciate men doing for them anymore, but they are things that this woman loves. You're so good to me, and even though I don't express it as often as I would like to or as often as I should, I want you to know that these simple things are part of the reason why I admire you so, and they are why I love you more than I ever thought possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've been so happy this last year that we have been together. I would say that I've always been a positive person and I try to look on the bright side of things, but being with you has brought me a joy that I have never known before. Life's just better with you in it, and I know that it always will be so. I hope that I will always be worthy of your love, and that I can be the kind of person that you deserve. I know that I'm not perfect, but I will strive to be the best person that I can be. You're worth it--definitely worth it. I know that we can do great things together. In fact, I think we can do anything together! I look forward with hope and excitement to the future we will build together. I can hardly wait!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Do you remember the first time that we discussed a serious relationship? We had gone to that Italian restaurant for lunch, and then we went for a drive up the canyon. As we walked along the trail there, you looked at me with so much caring, and you were so kind and attentive. It was then that I first started to think about our future, and now I know that there is no one else with whom I want to be. You've changed my life so completely. What would I ever do without you? I don't even want to think about it, and I pray that I never have to.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The more I get to know you, the more I want to know, and the more I can't wait for each new day, just to be with you, just to watch the sun rise in your arms and to see the smile on your face. Every day I love you more, and every day I realize to a greater extent how much this relationship means to me, how much you mean to me. You are everything to me.|Over the last few weeks, I have thought about how deep my love for you really is and how much it has grown in five years. When we were dating and I first fell in love with you, I couldn't imagine more love than that. Then came marriage, school, a child, life--we've shared all the ups and downs, and my love for you has blossomed from bud to flower. I cannot fathom a life without you. To me, you are life itself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You generously overlook my weaknesses and gently urge me to do better. Because I love you, I want to improve. Without your support, I don't think I would have been motivated to finish graduate school. The road would have been too long to travel alone. But, night after night, you were willing to create an atmosphere of study and even sat with me as I struggled to internalize difficult subjects. Although only my name is printed on the certificate, in a very real way, my degree is our degree. In return, I hope I have made your life a little easier, too.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At the end of the day, I can see that you are exhausted, especially after the baby is finally tucked into bed. I try to do the dishes and clean the kitchen--two jobs that you loathe. I know that you need a break. This is a little thing, but I want to help you carry the load. Being a mother and a wife is a 24/7 job--I'm just trying to make it 23/7.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I know we haven't had much money as we've sacrificed so much for school and trying to get started in a career. Vacations haven't been possible, but you find little things to look forward to each day. I enjoy sitting with you at breakfast and listening to you read the headlines. I love evening strolls in the park. I cherish our Friday dates--usually pizza and an old movie--when we snuggle on the coach and remember why we fell in love. You make every day a vacation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I was recalling the times that have been especially difficult for me. (The list has been pretty long these past six months.) We've both experienced some disappointment, but I've never seen you lose faith. I've come to lean on your example. Your unwavering belief that seasons change and that hard times will eventually yield to good helps me to keep putting one foot in front of the other. You're always there for me, even when the entire world seems to be against me. I give you my pledge that I will always be there for you.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You are the love of my life. I know that that little bud of love that is now in bloom will become a garden over the years. I love you deeply and completely. You mean everything to me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am forever yours.|I was thinking about you today. I was thinking about how well we fit together, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually as well. I feel like we are parts of a puzzle that fit together perfectly, and we are only whole when we are together. I thought I was happy before I met you, but now I know what true happiness is. You have changed my life for the better in so many ways.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I never knew that little things could mean so much. When I start to fall asleep on the couch, I love the way you cover me with a blanket. You leave me little notes in the steam on the mirror when you're done with your shower and it's my turn. And when you know I've had a really hard day, you always suggest we go out to dinner.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I like to do little things for you, too. I don't even think about it; I just want to do something to make your day better. When you have to work late, I bring you dinner. Before you leave on a trip, I always put a love note and a little surprise in your suitcase. And when you really get stressed, I rub your neck and listen as you tell me all about it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The past three years have been like a dream. I promise I'll always be there for you and I know you'll always be there for me. I love you. I hope you know that you mean the world to me. I don't like to think about what I would do if I ever lost you, because I know I'd only be half the woman that I am today.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
800|Love||You really hurt me. (But tell me your side of itI'm listening!)|"I'm writing this letter because I thought it would be better to write instead of talking to you in person, especially since both of us of usually have hair triggers on our emotions and tempers. Besides, I'm already upset, and I don't want to say anything I might regret later.<br><br><br><br><br><br>First of all, I want you to know how much I care about ""us"" and how important this relationship is to me. For example, you probably don't realize how much I've enjoyed all the discussions we've had together. I've found that we can talk intelligently about everything from Impressionist art to the exportation of American jobs. The more I get to know you, the more I find we have in common and the more I love you. And those ""I love you"" words seem to come as naturally to your lips as they do to mine. We've been together for over six months now and everything about our relationship has become more intimate. It was natural for me to stop seeing anyone else a long time ago and I believed that you had, too, because that is what you told me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Then I got a call from Laura this morning. She and Tom went out to dinner at the Olive Garden on Saturday night like they sometimes do. That was the day I had that miserable stomach virus and had to cancel our usual night out. Well, Laura told me she saw you in the restaurant having dinner with another woman that night. It hurts me to even write those words, but I'm just repeating what she told me. Could it be possible? I hope that she was wrong. After all, there are many good-looking guys in this world who like Italian food besides you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I realize there could also be an innocent explanation for the whole situation. After all, I've seen enough ""Law and Order"" episodes to know you can't convict someone on circumstantial evidence. I want to know the facts of this case so I can dismiss it as quickly as possible! You don't need a lawyer just tell me the truth. I need to know that you are still faithful to everything you've promised me and that you've not changed your mind about our future plans. I need to know that another woman has not come between us before I can go on the way we have been.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm staying with old roommate, Sheila, right now. You know the number--555-5555. I'll be waiting for your call, but if I get a letter instead, I'll prepare for the worst. After all, the worst scenario wouldn't be the end of the world--just the beginning of the end of our world."|I know it's been a few days since we talked, and I'm sorry I haven't returned your calls, but I just can't face you right now. Please know how much your friendship means to me--how much you mean to me. We've known each other for so long now and we've had a lot of good times over the years. I can still remember our parents plotting our marriage when we were in kindergarten. Do you remember that? Since then, we've always been able to offer each other a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I thought I was over being upset, but I'm not quite to that point yet. I know that we had decided that it would be best to see other people for the time being in order to give each other some space. It really hurts me, though, that you would ask my roommate out right off the bat. We were together for a long time, and I can't help feeling somewhat betrayed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now, I don't think that you had ulterior motives in asking her out. I don't really believe that you would do it to hurt me, either, but I couldn't believe it when Christine told me that you had asked her out and that the two of you went to dinner on Tuesday. I'm confused right now, and I hardly know what to think. I assumed you knew how I would feel about that kind of thing--about going out with someone so close to me so soon. Would you please tell me what you were thinking?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I might need some time to sort this out before we see each other again, but I hope we can straighten things out soon.|"I've found that writing down my thoughts is sometimes better than struggling to express my feelings out loud. Besides, we both know that emotions tend to blur everything. I'm already trying to deal with hurt feelings and bouts of anger. I'd rather not stick my foot in my mouth and find myself unable to take something back that I regretted saying!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let me start by saying that I care about our relationship. Otherwise our argument wouldn't have mattered to me and I wouldn't be taking the time to write this letter. I can't help but remember all the good times we've shared: late-night walks, movies, and dinner at the beach. I've treasured our talks and how we have discovered our many shared interests. In the short time we've known each other we have years of history--too much to set aside lightly, I hope. I've surprised myself by being able to express my love for you easily. In a significant way, you taught me how to say those three important words--words I had once thought I would never be able to say sincerely but they were and are sincere. As our relationship has progressed and become more intimate, the word ""love"" has become a natural part of my vocabulary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>That is why what you said to me hurt so deeply. I can't say it more plainly than that. I felt as if I had been punched and knocked over and I fell down emotionally. I was totally unprepared for a comment like that to come from your lips. During all the months we have dated, I have never heard you say anything that resembled that remark. How is it possible that you could have said it? Did you really mean it? Please say ""no."" Please say it was just a poor choice of words or bad timing or unintentional--or something!<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't think you can imagine how much it hurt me, but I don't want to continue feeling this way. Please help me understand what happened so we can put it behind us and move forward. I need closure. I need to know where you stand and if this will affect us in the future. I have not changed my mind about our relationship, but I am in desperate need of clarification.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm anxiously awaiting your reply."|I saw you last night. It was Friday night and I was at the mall shopping for Mother's Day presents for both of our mothers. I saw a car that looked a lot like yours in the parking lot by Sears, but I didn't think anything of it until I saw you walk out of the store, get into the car, and drive away. I sat there in the driver's seat, stunned. You told me that you had to go out of town on business. Your flight left Friday morning and you wouldn't be back until Sunday.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't understand. Why did you lie to me? I'm trying so hard not to overreact. I want to believe that there's a good explanation, although I'm not sure what that would be. I thought that we had a good relationship and that we could always talk to each other. I trusted you. I believed everything you told me. How can I believe a word you say now? And how can we continue this relationship if it isn't built on honest communication and mutual trust and respect?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I really want you to explain to me what you were doing Friday night. I want to hear your side of things. I don't want this relationship to be over, but if it is, I want to know now. Please call me.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

I must agree that the situation is a difficult one.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I suggest that you start off by speaking to the entire group about the problem without singling out one individual. If that has the desired result, you need take no further action, but if Mr. Doe persists in this behavior, you will then be able to speak to him privately, reminding him of what you said previously. This way, you will still have the option of using the grievance process later if it becomes necessary, but you will have at least tried to minimize confrontation between the coworkers. In any case, I am confident that you will be able to handle the problem with tact and diplomacy!||||||||||||||||||||||||||

I am opposed to the idea for two reasons.<br><br><br><br><br><br>First, it is not cost effective. If the county is going to invest $350,000 for school facilities, it might as well invest another $50,000 and include facilities for eighth grade students too.

The county will probably spend that much to maintain the run-down facility that eighth graders currently occupy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My second reason for opposing the plan is that it would be emotionally difficult for the students to be isolated. Students at that age want to feel as though they are entering a higher level of education with older peers. It would be a letdown for them to be alone for a year before experiencing junior high school.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please consider these concerns and present them to the school board.

These conditions appear on the box the seat covers came in. We will comply with our warranty as soon as we receive these items.|I can imagine how disappointed you must have been to discover that the backpack you bought from Doe Camping Supply was too small to hold your gear for an extended trip. While I sympathize with your plight, you did buy the backpack during our two-day Thanksgiving Blowout Sale. Signs posted during the sale said that we could offer no refunds or exchanges. This is the only way that Doe's can continue to bring you such low prices on our blowout sales. Having to process returns and exchanges would greatly increase the price of the gear.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am enclosing a $5.00 gift certificate you can redeem at any Doe Camping Supply store.

We wish you much success in this worthy cause.|We recently received your request for donations to local school libraries. We recognize the need for improvement in our children's schools and appreciate your initiative in gathering donations for new books.

In the meantime, please accept our sincerest wishes for success.|Thank you for thinking of Doe's Auto Repair as a company interested in the community.

I have watched the City Cupboard program with great admiration for sometime now. Sadly, we are over-committed for charitable donations this year and will not be able to help you at this time.

Please contact us around June next year, and we may be able to help you then.|Recently, I received your fundraising letter describing the financial support required to realize the upcoming programs and services of (Name of Organization). As you know, I admire and feel connected to the purpose and mission of your organization, and I am amazed by the effects of the services you provide. During past fundraising drives, I was able to express my admiration and support of your endeavors with a monetary donation. However, at this time, I regret to say that I am unable to contribute funds to your cause, but please do not view this inability as an expression of my wavering support. I continue to value highly the work that (Name of Organization) does, and I hope to be able to express my admiration and support of the organization again in the future.|I am so sorry that I will be unable to donate to this year's March Campaign. I strongly believe in the work you are doing and have given each year for many years, but my personal circumstances prevent me from helping you right now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If matters improve, I will send a check later this year, but in any case, please don't remove me from your mailing list.

After careful consideration, however, we have decided not to make you an offer at this time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We received applications from a large number of extremely qualified applicants.

Unfortunately, I had to ask the delivery boy to return it, because we are not allowed to accept gifts from clients. Still, I sincerely appreciated the gesture and look forward to our continued association.|You must have read my mind. I have been admiring your beautiful fountain pen since we first met. To make it a gift to me was very thoughtful.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Sadly, I cannot accept your generosity because company policy prohibits employees from receiving gifts. But be assured that I will not forget your kind gesture.|I was very touched by your thoughtful offer to babysit my children during the vacation I had planned. Recently, however, I have had a change of heart and will no longer be taking the vacation. Nonetheless, I deeply appreciate your generosity and I hope to be able to repay it some day.|How kind of you to send me tickets to Saturday's ball game! Regretfully, I must decline the gift.

Whatever you decide to do, you have my best wishes.|Although I am flattered that you have asked for my advice, I am sorry that I must decline your request.

I wish you success in your new project.|I received your letter asking me for advice on how to invest the insurance settlement you recently received.

There are many qualified, reputable professionals who can advise you better than I could.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I wish you the best in finding someone who can help you with this important matter. I look forward to seeing you at the Club's annual holiday party next month.|Much as I would like to take some of the credit for the next great decision in your life, I must bow out.

913|Refusal||Decline orders but offer an alternate or substitute item|We were pleased to receive your request for our classic, windowless model of BreadMax, the most popular bread-making machine on the market.

While we're sorry for the inconvenience this may possibly cause you, we've found that virtually all our customers ordering by phone, when told of our recent change, have gladly opted for BreadMax II. They consider the additional $1.75 a small price to pay for the useful window feature. BreadMax II is essentially identical to our original model, differing only in its new window and a new latch design for improved insulation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Upon your request, we will immediately process your order, substituting Bread Max II for the unavailable model.

We do, however, sell a Swedish Compost Toilet that is a very effective mode of waste disposal.<br><br><br><br><br><br>While some Americans shy away from the compost toilet, you will find the system both practical and economical.

Thank you for choosing Doe's, where ecology and practicality go hand in hand.|We are please you have chosen to order your poinsettias from Doe Nurseries. We offer our customers the highest qualities plants at the lowest prices.

In a sense, my work there complements the work of the Lodge.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Perhaps when my current term of service is over, I will be able to reconsider your offer, if it still stands. Thank you for considering me. I wish you success in all your endeavors.|Thank you for your kindness in asking me to join your lodge. Because other commitments require my attention on Tuesday evenings, I regret that I cannot accept the invitation at this time. If you would consider me for membership again next year, it is probable that I could join. Please accept my sincere wishes for continued success.|I was flattered by your invitation to join such a worthwhile organization such as the Springfield Women's League.

I'm not sure I can handle another commitment in addition to raising my young children.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Perhaps in a few years my time will again be my own.

918|Refusal||Decline to write a letter of recommendation|I received your request for a letter of recommendation yesterday and hope you will understand if I decline.

919|Refusal||Deny an expected or hoped-for promotion or raise|Because you do so much so well, I regret having to report that management has denied my request to raise your position from a Level 8 to a Level 10.

Best wishes in your business.|Thank you for submitting your landscaping bid for the Doe Inc. offices on Main St. We have decided to accept a competitor's bid instead of the one you submitted.

We appreciate the thoroughness of your proposal, and the timely manner in which you returned it to us with the requested changes.

While we have had some minor problems with our electrical subcontractor in the past, our relationship has been a long and rewarding one, and we choose to remain loyal to our friends. Yours is a very good name in the business. If the problems persist, or if we require more work than our current electricians can handle, we will be in contact with you.|Thank you for your inquiry regarding Springfield Yacht Club's hull cleaning services. Unfortunately, we will not be able to take on the task of cleaning your yacht because our dry dock is not large enough. May I recommend Doe Marina's services? Good luck.|The recent price increase on the materials we purchase from your company has caused us to look for another source for these materials. We have found another supplier who is able to fill our needs at a lower price; therefore, we are terminating our current contract with you, effective May 1.

922|Refusal||Reply negatively to a suggestion|Thank you for your great suggestions on how we could use the left-over budget money. I can tell you have given a lot of thought to your ideas, and if I had received your memo three weeks earlier, perhaps we would have used them. I am sorry to inform you that we have already allocated the money, but I think you will not be too disappointed with our decision to give the money to the local library to benefit our community's children for many years.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for your thoughtfulness. I am pleased that other members of our society also feel that we should donate the money to charity.|Thank you for your suggestion that we move the air hoses from the vicinity of the gas pumps to an area near the edge of the station property. Unfortunately we are not able to move the hoses at this time because it would necessitate digging up the island and driveway areas.

We welcome the input and ideas of our loyal customers.|I have studied your suggestion to change the timing of the traffic lights along Springfield's Main Street. Your study is thorough and offers a new perspective. Your plan would certainly make the trip through town easier for a few drivers, but others would be caught in long lines behind a single light as it turns red.

947|Resignation||Resign from a job in which you are not valued or appreciated|I am sorry to inform you that I have decided to resign from my position as a computer programmer in order to seek a more rewarding position elsewhere. This resignation must become effective no later than two weeks from today's date.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have concluded that my contributions here are unrewarded and my ideas ignored. I have much to offer and feel frustrated that I am consistently passed over for special projects. It is important to me to work for a company that encourages creativity rather than restricts it. Although your compensation has been fair, you have been unable to provide other types of incentives that I need.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, my time here has not been wasted. I have gained experience and have honed my skills. I have worked with a dedicated group who has earned my respect and admiration. I sincerely wish co-workers well in their future endeavors.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because you have indicated that my work is excellent, I would appreciate a positive recommendation from you should any prospective employers inquire about my qualifications. If you feel you are unable to satisfy this request, I would sincerely value an opportunity to discuss with you any reservations you may have.|This letter is to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as a technical writer, effective in two weeks.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Again, I have been passed over for promotion. Despite sterling evaluations from my superiors, the challenges and rewards I seek from my employment do not appear to be forthcoming. It is, therefore, unconscionable for me to remain with a company that neither rewards my accomplishments nor recognizes my potential.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My frustration, however, does not diminish the fact that my friendships here have been a source of pleasure and satisfaction. I wish everyone the very best.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because all my projects are complete and my assignments are up to date, my replacement should have little difficulty taking over my responsibilities. However, if any problems should arise, you may contact me at 555-5555, and I will be happy to respond to any questions you or my replacement may have.|This letter is to notify you of my intent to resign from my position as Assistant Personnel Supervisor. Please make my resignation effective as soon as a replacement is hired, but no later than the end of next month.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although I enjoy my job tremendously, I am terribly disappointed that I received only a 2 percent salary increase this year. My evaluations have been consistently outstanding, but my salary does not appropriately reflect this fact. I live from paycheck to paycheck, so I require a moderate increase in order to meet escalating living expenses.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Despite my frustration, I will always be thankful for the opportunity I have had to improve my skills and gain additional experience. Undoubtedly, my responsibilities here have helped furnish me with the expertise required for the position I recently accepted with another company at a much higher salary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because several of my co-workers share the same responsibilities that I do, the transition should not be difficult. If there is anything I can do before I leave, please let me know.|I am resigning as apartment manager--effective in two weeks. We have talked many times about apartment repairs, city code compliance and parking shortages. You continue to make promises, I continue to stave off angry tenants and the problems remain. I enjoy interacting with the tenants, but not on these terms. I also have apartment problems of my own and so I sympathize with their complaints. Please accept my resignation along with my notice to vacate the apartment, effective at the end of this month.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
948|Resignation||Resign from a job because of a personality clash or conflict of values|Experiences over the past several months convince me that I must resign from my position as counselor, effective no later than two weeks from today. When I was initially hired at Doe Corporation, I thought that this was a company believed, as I did, that the relationship between a company and its employees should be mutually beneficial. Poor wages, infrequent raises, uncompensated overtime, routine layoffs, and an excessive workload have convinced me otherwise. Therefore, I can no longer work for a company that clearly undervalues the worth of its employees.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I want to thank you, however, for being a wonderful supervisor. I appreciate the time you took to discuss my concerns with me. I know you did everything you could to improve our working conditions, but the fact that your efforts have been persistently ignored by upper management is indicative that things are not about to change in the near future. I sincerely hope that my resignation does not adversely reflect upon you in any way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Two weeks should provide adequate time for me to complete my assignments. According to current policy, I suspect my duties will be assimilated in the usual way. Nonetheless, I will gladly ensure that my more difficult accounts are settled before I leave.|Regretfully I inform you that I must resign from my position as a counselor, effective immediately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Three weeks ago, my supervisor informed me that a co-worker was criticizing my work. According to my superiors, she gained access to my personal files and work bins. She then alerted my supervisor and the office manager about my supposed violations of company policy and file errors. Although I may have erred unintentionally, I think it is inexcusable to allow another employee to rummage through my area without my consent. Your unwillingness to challenge this violation of my privacy makes it impossible for me to feel secure working at Doe Corporation any longer..<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because I have enjoyed working here up to this time, my decision to resign is not taken lightly. The work is both exciting and challenging. During my tenure I have gained important skills that will be useful in years to come.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I regret that these circumstances make it necessary for me to leave abruptly. In order to allow my successor to assume my duties without undue effort, however, I am leaving detailed instructions that explain each of my responsibilities in detail.|Please accept this letter as official notification of my intent to resign from my position as a counselor, effective two weeks from today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ever since Doe Corporation hired a new manager, I have been in turmoil. The relationship between employee and manager should be one of mutual respect and support. Instead, our current manager uses bullying and verbal abuse as a management style. Unfortunately, these tactics directly oppose my personal business philosophy, which advocates a more sensitive approach. Not only is it unconscionable for me to work in such a hostile environment, it is also physically and mentally debilitating to work under such stressful circumstances.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Resigning for these reasons is extremely disconcerting but, given the circumstances, I don't feel I have much choice. Senior management does not seem troubled by John's inappropriate behavior toward his employees and I, therefore, doubt that changes are imminent. These present difficulties do not negate the fact that I have derived much enjoyment in years past from my employment here. Also, the training I received here is superior to that of other companies. These considerations make this decision especially difficult. I sincerely hope to find another position as rewarding as this one has been.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Two weeks should be ample time for me to orient a replacement as well as to fulfill my obligations. If I can do anything else to facilitate an orderly transfer of duties, please let me know as soon as possible.|Please accept this letter as official notification of my intent to retire early. If convenient, I would like to schedule my date of departure for the end of this month. However, if you feel my leaving then will present serious difficulties for my associates, I will gladly stay until the end of next month. However, I don't believe there should be any reason for me to postpone my retirement beyond that time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Recent events have motivated me to reexamine my reasons for working here. Ever since this company acquired the Doe Corporation, I have been dissatisfied with my job. When I was originally hired, we agreed that my travel time would be kept to a minimum, but now I am expected to travel across the country each week auditing files. Unfortunately, my family obligations render this expectation unacceptable. Because I enjoyed my job so much before the merger, however, I am upset that it has come to this. But since I have been given no other alternative, I am confident this decision is in the best interest of all concerned.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The company has contributed immeasurably to my professional career. I will always be indebted to you for granting the financial assistance needed to further my education and for company-sponsored training seminars, which permitted me to acquire the proficiency needed to excel in my profession.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Although I plan to work elsewhere, I also intend to do some part-time consulting and would enjoy being involved in special short-term projects. Please let me know if you are interested in including me in these activities. If there is anything else you would like to discuss with me, I would be happy to meet with you at your convenience.|Effective immediately, I am resigning as buyer from Doe & Co. It is become increasingly apparent that this store is no longer listening to the fashion demands of its clientele. Instead it seems to be following the dictates of European designers that are foreign to our customers, in every sense of the word. Hence, our exotic merchandise remains on the floor for months and our accounts remain in the red. My experience has proven that customers from this area prefer merchandise that suits their home-grown tastes, and, frankly, so do I.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I do appreciate the opportunity to work here, however. I have learned a great deal about customer relations.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||
949|Resignation||Resign from a job when forced out under pressure|Disappointing and unexpected circumstances demand that I submit my resignation from my position as Area Coordinator, effective immediately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I recently received word that my territories have been reassigned and that I must either transfer to a neighboring state or submit my resignation. Because my husband's current position is far more lucrative than mine, it is not financially prudent for me to transfer to another location. I wish to seek another position similar to this one immediately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Despite my disappointment, I want to thank you for the excellent training I have received while working at Doe Corporation. I have no doubt that the skills I have acquired will enable me to find other employment more in line with my career objectives.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My files are in order and up to date. Each one has extensive notes detailing events that took place prior to reassigning the territories. My successor, therefore, should have little difficulty assuming my responsibilities.|Under extreme duress I submit this letter of resignation from my position as Project Planner, effective today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Over the past six months, my responsibilities have slowly been eliminated. When I started here I regularly put in 60 hours a week. Now, I sit in my office with little to do. Most of my responsibilities have been dispersed among my peers; yet additional assignments have not been forthcoming. Attempts to discover why this is so have been futile. For these reasons I have concluded that I must resign.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because my duties have largely been assumed by others, my leaving should not create any major problems. If there is anything you wish to settle, please notify me as soon as possible.|Given the choice to either resign or be discharged, I hereby submit my resignation from my position as a technical writer, effective two weeks from today.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because I don't understand why I have been forced to resign, I feel angry and betrayed. You requested that I quit publishing my writings on controversial topics while employed at Doe's, but you did not stipulate that I must also cease to do research. I have stopped publishing, but still you maintain that I have not fulfilled my obligation to you. In my view, this is wrongful termination and I will consult with an attorney shortly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I envisioned a long, fruitful career here at Doe's and I am deeply distressed that this is not going to be the case. My responsibilities were both challenging and rewarding. When a replacement is hired, I will gladly explain what this position entails and how to fulfill each obligation properly. Also, I will update my superiors and forward to them difficult or confusing projects that I am unable to complete before my departure.|I am resigning as air traffic controller, effective tomorrow I love my work and my record, prior to Tuesday's fatal runway accident, is flawless.

950|Resignation||Resign for family or personal reasons|I regretfully submit my resignation from my position as personnel director, effective two weeks from today. Although I love my job, my first priority is my family, and I have decided to stay home with my newborn child. When I first learned that I was pregnant, resignation was the last thing on my mind. But, now that she is born, I find I lack the courage to leave her in the care of a stranger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Your confidence in my abilities and genuine concern for my professional growth make this decision especially difficult. I will be forever grateful for the invaluable expertise I acquired while under your guidance. Also, the friendships I have developed here have helped make my years with the company successful and productive.

To facilitate a smooth transition, I plan to stay until the end of the month to complete my projects and help train my replacement.<br><br><br><br><br><br>My reasons for leaving are of a deeply personal nature, but rest assured they are not related to dissatisfaction with my job, the company, or my co-workers. On the contrary, I have experienced immense personal satisfaction, both from my job assignments and from the close friendships I have established with my co-workers. I regret that my current situation requires that I make this difficult decision now.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you will provide me with a favorable recommendation when I return to the job market. Also, if you feel there are any unresolved problems, I would appreciate discussing these problems with you so we can reach an amicable understanding before I leave.|Please accept my resignation as chief accountant, effective May 31, 2003.

This past eight months has been incredibly difficult as Jane and I have decided to end our marriage.

I also need to be there for them to help them cope with the emotional difficulties they face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for the terrific experience of being an editor for this paper. It's been educational, enraging, entertaining, etc. Perhaps my mastery of alliteration will help me in finding a part-time position.

951|Resignation||Resign for health reasons|With much reluctance I wish to inform you of my resignation as Personnel Director, effective as soon as arrangements can be made to hire a new director. Last week, while inquiring about changes in my productivity, we discussed the fact that despite adequate sleep and nutrition I had been feeling unusually tired. We concluded that a visit to the doctor was in order. Since then, my doctor has informed me that I have Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome (CFIDS). Unfortunately, the erratic hours and the fast pace of our work environment worsen the effects of my illness. For these reasons, my doctor has advised a cessation of all work activity and full bed rest for an indefinite amount of time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I am distressed that poor health dictates that I must quit my job. I searched a long time to find the kind of job that not only encourages the use of my creativity and is intellectually stimulating, but also affords an opportunity to meet with a variety of people on a daily basis.

I can no longer bear the high level of stress here at the Medical Center. I am, however, glad for the opportunity I have had to work here.

Fortunately, I discovered this before expending time and money in a field that is not right for me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I decided to quit last week when Jane Doe notified me that she wanted to return to work here as soon as we had an opening. Since Jane is a previous employee, training her for this position would not be an issue. As she can assume my duties immediately, this should provide a workable solution for all parties involved.|Although I enjoy working here at Doe Realty, I am compelled to offer my resignation as a field representative, effective two weeks from today, or sooner if possible. I wish I could do otherwise but recent events have persuaded me to carefully examine the direction my life is taking.

Let me assure you, my decision to retire early is as unexpected for me as it is for you.

Hence, it is imperative that I contemplate my early retirement and plan for a more serene lifestyle.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Please accept my heartfelt thanks for your support, encouragement, and cooperation over the years. I have been fortunate, indeed, to work for a company that provides a challenging yet pleasant atmosphere. Close ties cultivated with my co-workers have greatly enriched my life. My admiration and respect for them make it that much more disappointing to end my career with Doe Corporation. It is truly disheartening that the state of my health must govern my decision to retire.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Because I understand that my precipitous departure could create transitional problems, I want to assure you that I will do everything possible to see that my duties are efficiently assumed by my replacement.

I must agree that the situation is a difficult one.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I suggest that you start off by speaking to the entire group about the problem without singling out one individual. If that has the desired result, you need take no further action, but if Mr. Doe persists in this behavior, you will then be able to speak to him privately, reminding him of what you said previously. This way, you will still have the option of using the grievance process later if it becomes necessary, but you will have at least tried to minimize confrontation between the coworkers.

992|Response|Miscellaneous Response-Letters|Give professional advice|When you asked my advice on your decision to take on a partner, I knew you were in a tough spot. My own first partnership became a positive experience, but it took some special care. It is, I think, a good move to take John on as full partner.

I opened my business when I was about your age, and I remember what a difficult decision it was for me.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Working for yourself has both pros and cons. On the one hand, you are your own boss and can set your own schedule and do things the way you want to.

We encourage each of you to write your suggestions on paper and put them in the office suggestion box. We are awarding two free dinners at Does for the winning suggestion.

I know the best ideas come from our employees, and I look forward to your suggestions.|We sincerely welcome suggestions from employees on how to both improve our product and our customer services. To encourage you to make suggestions, we are instituting a system for rewarding the employee whose suggestion the company chooses to implement. Each month management will select the best idea and award a bonus to the winner. The bonus will consist of a gift certificate or a half day off with pay.|Over the years, some of our best ideas have come from our customers. Our annual spring sale was a customer's idea.

Just last week three homes in the neighborhood were robbed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I suggest we dedicate our next committee meeting to discussing some practical solutions to this serious problem. I believe if we work together, we can find a workable answer.|We who live in the University Garden area of town have 25 elementary school children who must cross busy Main Street to attend Springfield School. Please consider permitting University Garden students to attend Doe School, which is on our side of Main Street. This would be advantageous for the following reasons:<br><br><br><br><br><br>1. The children would not have to cross Main Street<br><br><br><br><br><br>2. It would relieve crowding at Springfield School<br><br><br><br><br><br>3. The school district would save the cost of the crossing guard.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Even though the children would have to walk an additional two blocks to school, the increase in safety would be worth it. Please consider this suggestion at your next board meeting. I am willing to address the board if you think it would be helpful. I shall look forward to your reply.|I wonder if your weekly newsletter would be better received by the rank and file employees if they were given space for articles they wish to share. Such articles could include giving advice about specific tasks or describing motivational methods. They could be signed or printed anonymously.|"You did a great job with your presentation yesterday. Your visuals were especially effective; however, I would like to make one suggestion. A few of your jokes were inappropriate to your audience.

There are enough ""clean"" jokes left to spice up a presentation that do not risk offending your audience."||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

In the long-run it could save you a lot of money and worry. Please contact me to make an appointment at 555-5555.|We regret that we are unable to supply you with the bookkeeping forms you usually use. With the majority of small businesses using computers, the older forms are difficult to find. You may wish to make the transition to computer bookkeeping yourself. All types of posting can be done more quickly and more accurately than with traditional methods. Although the initial investment seems high, I believe you would find, as we have, that the time saved and the accuracy achieved are well worth the money. We have several computer models with compatible software that we could tailor to your needs. You are welcome to drop in and investigate this possibility.|Several times during the past six months you were late in making the minimum payment required as stated in our agreement. We are reluctant to charge penalties for such infractions and offer the following suggestion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Often our customers choose a payment schedule that does not fit their budget needs or they find that their financial situation has changed.

However, I think that our elderly members may feel a bit left out, especially during this holiday season. May I suggest that we form a group whose sole purpose is to fellowship and provide useful activities for the elderly? They have so much to give, and we need to provide an opportunity for them to do so.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If I can help you in any way, please let me know.|Even though snow still covers the ground, I have been thinking of spring and with that, Mother's Day. I have heard that some congregations honor mothers on that Sunday with a flower or other small gift, and it struck me as a nice gesture. I think it would be good to give each mother a small rose or a potted plant such as a geranium. I favor a potted plant because it would last at least through the summer. I know that cost is always a concern, but the horticulture club at the university grows plants to raise funds, and the cost is very reasonable. If the idea appeals to you, I will be happy to look into the matter and give you more specific information. Please let me know whether this is something you would like to do.|Because of the aging population of our congregation, many members have suffered the death of close family and friends. Pain from these losses is difficult to overcome but can perhaps be lessened if shared with others.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I propose that we help organize a support group for these individuals and allow them to meet weekly in the church library.

I really think we can make this work.|The work load for secretaries in your department has increased steadily to the point where we need more help. Unfortunately, our limited space makes it impractical to have more than one additional secretary in the office at the same time, so we are looking at other options.

Only one of those decisions resulted in loss of production time, and this loss was subsequently recovered by your crew.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In my many years as production manager, I learned best during those times when things went wrong; I rarely made the same judgment error twice. You may find that this to be the case in your work.|I've been observing you around the office, and I have some advice you may find valuable. I think you have a natural talent for sales. You get appointments with some of the most incredible people. Still, with all that talent, you will only go so far if you don't begin to manage your time in the office better. You've been given all the tools for effective time management. Use them. Start now and you will reap huge benefits over time. If you need any help, let me know. I realize this was unsolicited.

I hope we can solve the problem quickly.|After working with the Doe team for two months, I believe I have enough understanding of their project to offer some suggestions that would benefit both the company and our customers. Although our team members have the best of intentions, their focus ignores what we have learned from our customers in the past. Before we go any further, I think we should show the product to some customers to get their reactions. I have some ideas about this that I would like to present to you in person. I am confident you will agree after you hear what I have to say. Are you free sometime Monday morning?|The full-time employees have designated me as their spokesperson to suggest a shorter work week. We would like you to consider instituting four ten-hour days in place of the current five eight-hour days. The shifts could be staggered, of course, so the office would still be covered during the usual five days. Enclosed is a copy of an article from the local newspaper featuring companies that have adopted the longer hours for fewer days concept. They report their productivity is up, absenteeism is down, and their workers are happier overall.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our employees would welcome the change. I have taken the liberty of charting a sample work schedule that could be implemented. A copy is attached. I would be pleased to meet with you if you think this plan has merit. I look forward to your response.|The revised management policy is causing anxiety among my department employees who object to undergoing weekly rather than monthly performance reviews. Several employees have expressed concerns that shortening the time period may not produce fair averages of individual or department production. They fear that one poor evaluation may result in sanctions.|I have reviewed the plans to move the Doe Subsidiary to Springfield and have some concerns. First, we can achieve the same benefits by moving the subsidiary to Centerville, 400 miles closer to headquarters. Second, the average hourly cost of an employee is $4.00 less in Centerville, resulting in a total savings of at least $500,000 per year. Finally, corporate taxes are lower in Centerville.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I realize that there may be other reasons to move to Springfield that outweigh what I have mentioned.

Please let me know as soon as possible.|I have a suggestion that I believe would make shopping at your Springfield store more inviting. I appreciate your desire to carry a wide variety of merchandise, but I believe that a slight reduction in variety could reduce congestion in the aisles and make many customers very happy. It seems that the congestion is discouraging to some, especially those who have difficulty reaching the high shelves or who need carts to carry their purchases. If a reduction in variety is not possible, I would suggest that you move the advertising displays to the front of the store to free up more aisle space.|We now order 50% of our office supplies from you and offer a suggestion that may increase this another 50%. Our business requires that we fill inventory requests quarterly which means that we need packaging tape and cardboard boxes quarterly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At this time we order from you and Doe. If you will change your delivery schedule from semi-annually to quarterly you can become our sole supplier for these items. Your sales will increase, and we will reduce our paperwork.|Unless you are interested in an idea that will save time, eliminate waste, and increase profits, you should throw this letter away. Have you ever considered sending your spring catalogue with your Christmas orders? We always receive your catalogue two weeks after Christmas. By including the catalogue with our Christmas order, you would save mail costs, save envelopes, and give your customers more time to read your beautiful catalogue, resulting in more sales and profits.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I hope you find this idea useful.
