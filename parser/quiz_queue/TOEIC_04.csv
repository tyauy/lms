From:  Amy Strain < amy_strain@yahoo.com >
Subject:  Account #0368338126
 
Dear Ms. Raymond,             
 
I recently received my bank statement for the month of November, and I have a couple of concerns.  I hope you can help me figure them out. 
 
I noticed on November 10th I was charged $2.50 to withdraw funds from an ATM inside Riverside Mall.  It was my understanding, when I opened the account, that I was able to use any ATM and not accrue service charges.  While $2.50 may not seem like a lot, it can certainly add up! 
 
On November 25th, I noticed that $10.00 was withdrawn from my account, and I cannot figure out why.  I work hard to keep up with my check register, and I’m quite certain that I haven’t bounced any checks.
 
Your reply is much appreciated because I am really upset by these charges and withdrawals.  I would like for my account to be corrected as soon as possible.
 
Thank you,
Amy Strain

Dear Ms. Strain,
 
I am sorry for the confusion regarding your November statement.  Allow me to explain the charge and withdrawal so that you understand where they came from. 
 
The ATM fee of $2.50 on November 10th came from the financial institution that owns the ATM machine (National Banking Corp).  First American Bank allows you to use outside ATMs without incurring any extra charges, however, we cannot guarantee that there will not be a charge to your account from the bank that owns the machine.  In this case, National Banking Corp charged you $2.50 since you are not a customer of their bank.  As a customer courtesy, we will credit your account $2.50 to reimburse this fee.  In the future, please be sure that you agree to any fees from outside ATMs before completing the transaction.
 
You were charged $10.00 on November 25th because a check you deposited from Cindy White was returned due to insufficient funds.  Unfortunately, we must withdraw the money from your account since that check was returned.  Perhaps you can request a new check from the individual, or you may ask for cash or a cashier’s check to guarantee funds. 
 
I hope your questions have been answered, and I hope that you enjoy being a customer of First American.  We are proud to have you as a customer.
 
Sincerely, 
Patty Raymond

I noticed on November 10th I was charged $2.50 to withdraw funds from an ATM inside Riverside Mall.  It was my understanding, when I opened the account, that I was able to use any ATM and not accrue service charges.  While $2.50 may not seem like a lot, it can certainly add up! 
 
On November 25th, I noticed that $10.00 was withdrawn from my account, and I cannot figure out why.  I work hard to keep up with my check register, and I’m quite certain that I haven’t bounced any checks.
 
Your reply is much appreciated because I am really upset by these charges and withdrawals.  I would like for my account to be corrected as soon as possible.
 
Thank you,
Amy Strain

Dear Ms. Strain,
 
I am sorry for the confusion regarding your November statement.  Allow me to explain the charge and withdrawal so that you understand where they came from. 
 
The ATM fee of $2.50 on November 10th came from the financial institution that owns the ATM machine (National Banking Corp).  First American Bank allows you to use outside ATMs without incurring any extra charges, however, we cannot guarantee that there will not be a charge to your account from the bank that owns the machine.  In this case, National Banking Corp charged you $2.50 since you are not a customer of their bank.  As a customer courtesy, we will credit your account $2.50 to reimburse this fee.  In the future, please be sure that you agree to any fees from outside ATMs before completing the transaction.
 
You were charged $10.00 on November 25th because a check you deposited from Cindy White was returned due to insufficient funds.  Unfortunately, we must withdraw the money from your account since that check was returned.  Perhaps you can request a new check from the individual, or you may ask for cash or a cashier’s check to guarantee funds. 
 
I hope your questions have been answered, and I hope that you enjoy being a customer of First American.  We are proud to have you as a customer.
 
Sincerely, 
Patty Raymond
Account Representative

Your deli is just down the street from where I work, and not too far from my home.  It would be so convenient to frequent your establishment.  I love the idea of “fresh and creative” foods, and I look forward to seeing the things that you offer.  I really would like to see some flavored teas and small desserts offered to go along with what sounds to be an interesting menu already.  It is important, in my opinion, to help support local eateries and entrepreneurs, so I plan on visiting your deli – win or lose!  I appreciate you taking the time to offer such a contest to show the public that you appreciate their business.  Looking forward to your opening soon!

To Whom It May Concern:
 
I would like to have my account closed so that I may transfer it to Western Wireless.  There are several reasons why I have become unhappy with Horizon Cellular and have decided to request a transfer to Western. 
?        I feel the $75 monthly fee is rather exorbitant for the services provided.  That money only covers 300 minutes of phone usage!  If I want to use any texting options or internet usage, I have to pay on an individual basis, and these things are extremely costly!
?        I have too many dropped calls.  Your coverage shows that I should have no problem with coverage all over town, yet calls are dropped on a weekly basis. 
?        I would like the opportunity to upgrade my phone more often.  With your company, I only have that option once every two years.
?        My experiences with customer service have been more than lacking.  I haven’t had my questions answered or my problems resolved.
I hope that you will allow me to close my account without any trouble.  I understand that there is a fee for cancelling, but I do not feel I need to pay the fee since you are not meeting your end of the contract.  I look forward to hearing from you so that I may move on to Western Wireless.

Dear Ms. Steward,
 
Let me begin by extending my regrets that you have had a negative experience with Horizon Cellular.  We strive to have a cellular company you can enjoy and be proud of.  I see that you have listed several items that you are unhappy with.  While I am saddened to see so many areas that have caused problems for you, I do appreciate you bringing them to my attention.  I would like to offer a free upgrade to you at this time.  We also have new cellular plans that do include texting and internet usage.  Enclosed, you will find a flyer showing the packages we offer. 
 
I hope that you will take the opportunity to try one of our packages.  If, after trying one of our complete packages, you are still not satisfied with our service, I will drop the contract fee so you may try another company.
 
Sincerely,
Wesley Grant

Enclosed, you will find a flyer showing the packages we offer. 
 
I hope that you will take the opportunity to try one of our packages.  If, after trying one of our complete packages, you are still not satisfied with our service, I will drop the contract fee so you may try another company.
 
Sincerely,
Wesley Grant
Case Manager, Horizon Cellular

To Whom It May Concern:
 
I would like to have my account closed so that I may transfer it to Western Wireless.  There are several reasons why I have become unhappy with Horizon Cellular and have decided to request a transfer to Western. 
?        I feel the $75 monthly fee is rather exorbitant for the services provided.  That money only covers 300 minutes of phone usage!  If I want to use any texting options or internet usage, I have to pay on an individual basis, and these things are extremely costly!
?        I have too many dropped calls.  Your coverage shows that I should have no problem with coverage all over town, yet calls are dropped on a weekly basis. 
?        I would like the opportunity to upgrade my phone more often.  With your company, I only have that option once every two years.
?        My experiences with customer service have been more than lacking.  I haven’t had my questions answered or my problems resolved.
I hope that you will allow me to close my account without any trouble.  I understand that there is a fee for cancelling, but I do not feel I need to pay the fee since you are not meeting your end of the contract.  I look forward to hearing from you so that I may move on to Western Wireless.
